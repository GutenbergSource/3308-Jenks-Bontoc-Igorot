<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After an expedition of two months in September,
October, and November, 1902, among the people of northern Luzon it was
decided that the Igorot of Bontoc pueblo, in the Province of
Lepanto-Bontoc, are as typical of the primitive mountain agriculturist
of Luzon as any group visited, and that ethnologic investigations
directed from Bontoc pueblo would enable the investigator to show the
culture of the primitive mountaineer of Luzon as well as or better than
investigations centered elsewhere.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Mrs. Jenks, the writer took up residence in Bontoc
pueblo the 1st of January, 1903, and remained five months. The
following data were gathered during that Bontoc residence, the previous
expedition of two months, and a residence of about six weeks among the
Benguet Igorot.</p>
<p>The accompanying illustrations are mainly from photographs. Some of
them were taken in April, 1903, by Hon. Dean C. Worcester, Secretary of
the Interior; others are the work of Mr. Charles Martin, Government
photographer, and were taken in January, 1903; the others were made by
the writer to supplement those taken by Mr. Martin, whose time was
limited in the area. Credit for each photograph is given with the
halftone as it appears.</p>
<p>I wish to express my gratitude for the many favors of the only other
Americans living in Bontoc Province during my stay there, namely,
Lieutenant-Governor Truman K. Hunt, M.D.; Constabulary Lieutenant (now
Captain) Elmer A. Eckman; and Mr. William F. Smith, American
teacher.</p>
<p>In the following pages native words have their syllabic divisions
shown by hyphens and their accented syllables and vowels marked in the
various sections wherein the words are considered technically for the
first time, and also in the vocabulary in <a href="#ch10">the last
chapter</a>. In all other places they are unmarked. A later study of
the language may show that errors have been made in writing sentences,
since it was not always possible to get a consistent answer to the
question as to what part of a sentence constitutes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1267" href="#xd21e1267" name=
"xd21e1267">14</a>]</span>a single word, and time was too limited for
any extensive language study. The following alphabet has been used in
writing native words.</p>

<p>It seems not improper to say a word here regarding some of my
commonest impressions of the Bontoc Igorot.</p>
<p>Physically he is a clean-limbed, well-built, dark-brown man of
medium stature, with no evidence of degeneracy. He belongs to that
extensive stock of primitive people of which the Malay is the most
commonly named. I do not believe he has received any of his
characteristics, as a group, from either the Chinese or Japanese,
though this theory has frequently been presented. The Bontoc man would
be a savage if it were not that his geographic location compelled him
to become an agriculturist; necessity drove him to this art of peace.
In everyday life his actions are deliberate, but he is not lazy. He is
remarkably industrious for a primitive man. In his agricultural labors
he has strength, determination, and endurance. On the trail, as a
cargador or burden bearer for Americans, he is patient and
uncomplaining, and earns his wage in the sweat of his brow. His social
life is lowly, and before marriage is most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1568" href="#xd21e1568" name=
"xd21e1568">15</a>]</span>primitive; but a man has only one wife, to
whom he is usually faithful. The social group is decidedly democratic;
there are no slaves. The people are neither drunkards, gamblers, nor
&ldquo;sportsmen.&rdquo; There is little &ldquo;color&rdquo; in the
life of the Igorot; he is not very inventive and seems to have little
imagination. His chief recreation&mdash;certainly his most-enjoyed and
highly prized recreation&mdash;is head-hunting. But head-hunting is not
the passion with him that it is with many Malay peoples.</p>
<p>His religion is at base the most primitive religion
known&mdash;animism, or spirit belief&mdash;but he has somewhere
grasped the idea of one god, and has made this belief in a crude way a
part of his life.</p>
<p>He is a very likable man, and there is little about his
primitiveness that is repulsive. He is of a kindly disposition, is not
servile, and is generally trustworthy. He has a strong sense of humor.
He is decidedly friendly to the American, whose superiority he
recognizes and whose methods he desires to learn. The boys in school
are quick and bright, and their teacher pronounces them superior to
Indian and Mexican children he has taught in Mexico, Texas, and New
Mexico.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1574src" href="#xd21e1574" name=

<p>Briefly, I believe in the future development of the Bontoc Igorot
for the following reasons: He has an exceptionally fine physique for
his stature and has no vices to destroy his body. He has courage which
no one who knows him seems ever to think of questioning; he is
industrious, has a bright mind, and is willing to learn. His
institutions&mdash;governmental, religious, and social&mdash;are not
radically opposed to those of modern civilization&mdash;as, for
instance, are many institutions of the Mohammedanized people of
Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago&mdash;but are such, it seems to me,
as will quite readily yield to or associate themselves with modern
institutions.</p>
<p>I recall with great pleasure the months spent in Bontoc pueblo, and
I have a most sincere interest in and respect for the Bontoc Igorot as
a man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1582" href="#xd21e1582" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The readers of this monograph are familiar with the
geographic location of the Philippine Archipelago. However, to have the
facts clearly in mind, it will be stated that the group lies entirely
within the north torrid zone, extending from 4&deg; 40&prime; northward
to 21&deg; 3&prime; and from 116&deg; 40&prime; to 126&deg; 34&prime;
east longitude. It is thus about <span class="measure" title=
"1,600 kilometers">1,000 miles</span> from north to south and
<span class="measure" title="880 kilometers">550 miles</span> from east
to west. The Pacific Ocean washes its eastern shores, the Sea of
Celebes its southern, and the China Sea its western and northern
shores. It is about <span class="measure" title="640 kilometers">630
kilometers, or 400 miles,</span> from the China coast, and lies due
east from French Indo-China. The <span class="corr" title=
"Source: Batan">Batanes</span> group of islands, stretching north of
Luzon, has members nearer Formosa than Luzon. On the southwest Borneo
is sighted from Philippine territory.</p>
<p>Briefly, it may be said the Archipelago belongs to
Asia&mdash;geologically, zo&ouml;logically, and
botanically&mdash;rather than to Oceania, and that, apparently, the
entire Archipelago has shared a common origin and existence. There is
evidence that it was connected with the mainland by solid earth in the
early or Middle Tertiary. For a long geologic time the land was low and
swampy. At the end of the Eocene a great upheaval occurred; there were
foldings and crumplings, igneous rock was thrust into the distorted
mass, and the islands were considerably elevated above the sea. During
the latter part of the Tertiary period the lands seem to have subsided
and to have been separated from the mainland.</p>
<p>About the close of the subsidence eruptions began which are
continued to the present by such volcanoes as Taal and Mayon in Luzon
and Apo in Mindanao. No further subsidence appears to have occurred
after the close of the Tertiary, though the gradual elevation beginning
then had many lapses, as is evidenced by the numerous sea beaches often
seen one above the other in horizontal tiers. The elevation continues
to-day in an almost invisible way. The Islands have been greatly
enlarged during the elevation by the constant building of coral around
the submerged shores.</p>
<p>It is believed that man had appeared in the great Malay Archipelago
before this elevation began. It is thought by some that he was in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1608" href="#xd21e1608" name=
"xd21e1608">18</a>]</span>Philippines in the later Tertiary, but there
are no data as yet throwing light on this question.</p>
<p>To-day the Archipelago lies like a large net in the natural pathway
of people fleeing themselves from the supposed birthplace of the
primitive Malayan stock, namely, from Java, Sumatra, and the adjacent
Malay Peninsula, or, more likely, the larger mainland. It spreads over
a large area, and is well fitted by its numerous islands&mdash;some
3,100&mdash;and its innumerable bays and coastal pockets to catch up
and hold a primitive, seafaring people.</p>
<p>There are and long have been daring Malayan pirates, and there is
to-day among the southern islands a numerous class&mdash;the
Samal&mdash;living most of the time on the sea, yet they all keep close
to land, except in time of calm, and when a storm is brewing they
strike out straight for the nearest shore like scared children. The
ocean currents and the monsoons have been greatly instrumental in
driving different people through the seas into the Philippine
net.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1614src" href="#xd21e1614" name=
"xd21e1614src">1</a> The Tagakola on the west coast of the Gulf of
Davao, Mindanao, have a tradition that they are descendants of men cast
on their present shores from a distant land and of the Manobo women of
the territory. The Bagobo, also in the Gulf of Davao, claim they came
to their present home in a few boats generations ago. They purposely
left their former land to flee from head-hunting, a practice in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1640" href="#xd21e1640" name=
"xd21e1640">19</a>]</span>their earlier home, but one they do not
follow in Mindanao. What per cent of the people coming originally to
the Archipelago was castaway, nomadic, or immigrant it is impossible to
judge, but there have doubtless also been many systematic and prolonged
migrations from nearby lands, as from Borneo, Celebes, Sangir, etc.</p>
<p>Primitive man is represented in the Philippines to-day not alone by
one of the lowest natural types of savage man the historic world has
looked upon&mdash;the small, dark-brown, bearded,
&ldquo;crisp-woolly&rdquo;-haired Negritos&mdash;but by some thirty
distinct primitive Malayan tribes or dialect groups, among which are
believed to be some of the lowest of the stock in existence.</p>
<p>In northern Luzon is the Igorot, a typical primitive Malayan. He is
a muscular, smooth-faced, brown man of a type between the delicate and
the coarse. In Mindoro the Mangiyan is found, an especially lowly
Malayan, who may prove to be a true savage in culture. In Mindanao is
the slender, delicate, smooth-faced brown man of which the Subano, in
the western part, is typical. There are the Bagobo and the extensive
Manobo of eastern Mindanao in the neighborhood of the Gulf of Davao,
the latter people following the Agusan River practically to the north
coast of Mindanao. In southeastern Mindanao, in the vicinity of Mount
Apo and also north of the Gulf of Davao, are the Ata. They are a
scattered people and evidently a Negrito and primitive Malayan mixture.
In Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija, Isabela, and perhaps Principe, of Luzon,
are the Ibilao. They are a slender, delicate, bearded people, with an
artistic nature quite different from any other now known in the island,
but somewhat like that of the Ata of Mindanao. Their artistic wood
productions suggest the incised work of distant dwellers of the
Pacific, as that of the people of New Guinea, Fiji Islands, or Hervey
Islands. The seven so-called Christian tribes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1646src" href="#xd21e1646" name="xd21e1646src">2</a> occupying
considerable areas in the coastwise lands and low plains of most of the
larger islands of the Archipelago, represent migrations to the
Archipelago subsequent to those of the Igorot and comparable
tribes.</p>
<p>The last migrations of brown men into the Archipelago are historic.
The Spaniard discovered the inward flow of the large Samal Moro
group&mdash;after his arrival in the sixteenth century. The movement of
this nomadic &ldquo;Sea Gipsy&rdquo; Samal has not ceased to-day, but
continues to flow in and out among the small southern islands.</p>
<p>Besides the peoples here cited there are a score of others scattered
about the Archipelago, representing many grades of primitive culture,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1653" href="#xd21e1653" name=
"xd21e1653">20</a>]</span>but those mentioned are sufficient to suggest
that the Islands have been very effective in gathering up and holding
divers groups of primitive men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1655src"

are many instances on record showing that people have been planted on
Pacific shores many hundred <span class="measure" title=

primitive Pacific Islanders have sent people adrift from their shores,
thus adding a rational cause to those many fortuitous causes for the
interisland migration of small groups of individuals.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;In 1696, two canoes were driven from Ancarso
to one of the Philippine Islands, a distance of <span class="measure"

before the wind for seventy days together, sailing from east to west.
Thirty-five had embarked, but five had died from the effects of
privation and fatigue during the voyage, and one shortly after their
arrival. In 1720, two canoes were drifted from a remote distance to one
of the Marian Islands. Captain Cook found, in the island of Wateo
Atiu<span class="corr" title="Not in source">,</span> inhabitants of
Tahiti, who had been drifted by contrary wind in a canoe, from some
islands to the eastward, unknown to the natives. Several parties have,
within the last few years, (prior to 1834), reached the Tahitian shores
from islands to the eastward, of which the Society Islands had never
before heard. In 1820, a canoe arrived at Maurua, about <span class=
"measure" title="fifty kilometers">thirty miles</span> west of
Borabora, which had come from Rurutu, one of the Austral Islands. This
vessel had been at sea between a fortnight and three weeks; and,
considering its route, must have sailed <span class="measure" title=
"eleven to thirteen hundred kilometers">seven or eight hundred
miles</span>. A more recent instance occurred in 1824: a boat belonging
to Mr. Williams of Raiatea left that island with a westerly wind for
Tahiti. The wind changed after the boat was out of sight of land. They
were driven to the island of Atiu, a distance of nearly <span class=
"measure" title="1,300 kilometers">eight hundred miles</span> in a
south-westerly direction, where they were discovered several months
afterwards. Another boat, belonging to Mr. Barff of Huahine, was
passing between that island and Tahiti about the same time, and has
never since been heard of; and subsequent instances of equally distant
and perilous voyages in canoes or open boats might be
cited.&rdquo;&mdash;(Ellis) Polynesian Researches, vol. I, p. 125.</p>

Bilan, in the southern highlands west of Gulf of Davao, Mindanao;
Bagobo, of west coast of Gulf of Davao, Mindanao; Bukidnon, of Negros;
Ibilao or Ilongot, of eastern central Luzon; Igorot, of northern Luzon;
the Lanao Moro, occupying the central territory of Mindanao between the
Bays of Iligan and Illana, including Lake Lanao; Maguindanao Moro,
extending in a band southeast from Cotabato, Mindanao, toward Sarangani
Bay, including Lakes Liguasan and Buluan; Mandaya, of southeastern
Mindanao east of Gulf of Davao; Mangiyan, of Mindoro: Manobo, probably
the most numerous tribe in Mindanao, occupying the valley of the Agusan
River draining northward into Butuan Bay and the extensive table-land
west of that river, besides in isolated territories extending to both
the east and west coasts of the large body of land between Gulf of
Davao and Illana Bay; Negrito, of several areas of wild mountains in
Luzon, Negros, Mindanao, and other smaller islands; the Sama, of the
islands in Gulf of Davao, Mindanao; Samal Moro, of scattered coastal
areas in southern Mindanao, besides the eastern and southern islands of
the Sulu or Jolo Archipelago; the Subano, probably the second largest
tribal group in Mindanao, occupying all the mountain territory west of
the narrow neck of land between Illana Bay and Pangul Bay; the Sulu
Moro, of Jolo Island; the Tagabili, on the southern coast of Mindanao
northwest of Sarangani Bay; the Tagakola, along the central part of the
west coast of Gulf of Davao, Mindanao; Tagbanua, of Paragua; Tinguian,
of western northern Luzon; Tiruray, south of Cotabato, Mindanao; Yakan
Moro, in the mountainous interior of Basilan Island, off the Mindanao
coast at Zamboanga. Under the names of these large groups must be
included many more smaller dialect groups whose precise relationship
may not now be confidently stated. For instance, the large Igorot group
is composed of many smaller groups of different dialects besides that
of the Bontoc Igorot of which this paper treats.&nbsp;<a class=

<h3 class="main">Igorot land</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Northern Luzon, or Igorot land, is by far the largest
area in the Philippine Archipelago having any semblance of regularity.
It is roughly rectangular in form, extending two and one-half degrees
north and south and two degrees east and west.</p>
<p>There are two prominent geographic features in northern Luzon. One
is the beautifully picturesque mountain system, the Caraballos, the
most important range of which is the Caraballos Occidentales, extending
north and south throughout the western part of the territory. This
range is the famous &ldquo;Cordillera Central&rdquo; for about
three-quarters of its extent northward, beyond which it is known as
&ldquo;Cordillera del Norte.&rdquo; The other prominent feature is the
extensive drainage system of the eastern part, the Rio Grande de
Cagayan draining northward into the China Sea about two-thirds of the
territory of northern Luzon. It is the largest drainage system and the
largest river in the Archipelago.</p>
<p>The surface of northern Luzon is made up of four distinct types.
First is the coastal plain&mdash;a consistently narrow strip of land,
generally not over <span class="measure" title="5 or 6 kilometers">3 or
4 miles</span> wide. The soil is sandy silt with a considerable
admixture of vegetable matter. In some places it is loose, and shifts
readily before the winds; here and there are stretches of alluvial clay
loam. The sandy areas are often covered with <span class="corr" title=
"Source: cocoanut">coconut</span> trees, and the alluvial deposits
along the rivers frequently become beds of nipa palm as far back as
tide water. The plain areas are generally poorly watered except during
the rainy season, having only the streams of the steep mountains
passing through them. These river beds are broad, &ldquo;quicky,&rdquo;
impassable torrents in the rainy season, and are shallow or practically
dry during half the year, with only a narrow, lazy thread flowing among
the bowlders.</p>
<p>This plain area on the west coast is the undisputed dwelling place
of the Christian Ilokano, occupying pueblos in Union, Ilokos Sur, and
Ilokos Norte Provinces. Almost nothing is known of the eastern coastal
plain area. It is believed to be extremely narrow, and has at least one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1682" href="#xd21e1682" name=
"xd21e1682">24</a>]</span>pueblo, of Christianized Tagalog&mdash;the
famous Palanan, the scene of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s capture.</p>
<p>The second type of surface is the coastal hill area. It extends from
the coastal plain irregularly back to the mountains, and is thought to
be much narrower on the eastern coast than on the western&mdash;in
fact, it may be quite absent on the eastern. It is the remains of a
tilted plain sloping seaward from an altitude of about <span class=
"measure" title="300 meters">1,000 feet</span> to one of, say,
<span class="measure" title="30 meters">100 feet</span>, and its hilly
nature is due to erosion. These hills are generally covered only with
grasses; the sheltered moister places often produce rank growths of
tall, coarse cogon grass.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1692src" href=
"#xd21e1692" name="xd21e1692src">1</a> The soil varies from dark clay
loam through the sandy loams to quite extensive deposits of coarse
gravel. The level stretches in the hills on the west coast are
generally in the possession of the Christian peoples, though here and
there are small pueblos of the large Igorot group. The Igorot in these
pueblos are undergoing transformation, and quite generally wear
clothing similar to that of the Ilokano.</p>
<p>The third type of surface is the mountain country&mdash;the
&ldquo;temperate zone of the Tropics&rdquo;; it is the habitat of the
Igorot. From the western coastal hill area the mountains rise abruptly
in parallel ranges lying in a general north and south direction, and
they subside only in the foothills west of the great level bottom land
bordering the Rio Grande de Cagayan. The Cordillera Central is as fair
and about as varied a mountain country as the tropic sun shines on. It
has mountains up which one may climb from tropic forest jungles into
open, pine-forested parks, and up again into the dense tropic forest,
with its drapery of vines, its varied hanging orchids, and its
graceful, lilting fern trees. It has mountains forested to the upper
rim on one side with tropic jungle and on the other with sturdy pine
trees; at the crest line the children of the Tropics meet and
intermingle with those of the temperate zone. There are gigantic,
rolling, bare backs whose only covering is the carpet of grass
periodically green and brown. There are long, rambling, skeleton ranges
with here and there pine forests gradually creeping up the sides to the
crests. There are solitary volcanoes, now extinct, standing like things
purposely let alone when nature humbled the surrounding earth. There
are sculptured lime rocks, cities of them, with gray hovels and
mansions and cathedrals.</p>
<p>The mountains present one interesting geologic feature. The
&ldquo;hiker&rdquo; is repeatedly delighted to find his trail passing
quite easily from one peak or ascent to another over a natural
connecting embankment. On either side of this connecting ridge is the
head of a deep, steep-walled canyon; the ridge is only <span class=
"measure" title="about a hunderd meters">a few hundred feet</span>
broad at base, and only <span class="measure" title=
"two to six meters">half a dozen to twenty feet</span> wide at the top.
These ridges invariably have the appearance of being composed of soft
earth, and not of rock. They are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1707" href="#xd21e1707" name=
"xd21e1707">25</a>]</span>appreciated by the primitive man, who takes
advantage of them as of bridges.</p>
<p>The mountains are well watered; the summits of most of the mountains
have perpetual springs of pure, cool waters. On the very tops of some
there are occasional perpetual water holes ranging from <span class=
"measure" title="3 to 30 meters">10 to 100 feet</span> across. These
holes have neither surface outlet nor inlet; there are two such within
two hours of Bontoc pueblo. They are the favorite wallowing places of
the carabao, the so-called &ldquo;water buffalo,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1714src" href="#xd21e1714" name="xd21e1714src">2</a>
both the wild and the half-domesticated animals.</p>
<p>The mountain streams are generally in deep gorges winding in and out
between the sharp folds of the mountains. Their beds are strewn with
bowlders, often of immense size, which have withstood the wearing of
waters and storms. During the rainy season the streams racing between
the bases of two mountain ridges are maddened torrents. Some streams,
born and fed on the very peaks, tumble <span class="measure" title=
"30, 150, even 450 meters">100, 500, even 1,500 feet</span> over
precipices, landing white as snow in the merciless torrent at the
mountain base. During the dry season the rivers are fordable at
frequent intervals, but during the rainy season, beginning in the
Cordillera Central in June and lasting well through October, even the
natives hesitate often for a week at a time to cross them.</p>
<p>The absence of lakes is noteworthy in the mountain country of
northern Luzon&mdash;in fact, in all of northern Luzon. The two large
lakes frequently shown on maps of Cagayan Province, one east and one
west of the Rio Grande de Cagayan near the eighteenth parallel, are not
known to exist, though it is probable there is some foundation for the
Spaniards&rsquo; belief in the existence of at least the eastern one.
In the bottom land of the Rio Grande de Cagayan, about six hours west
of Cabagan Nuevo, near the provincial border of Cagayan and Isabela,
there were <span class="measure" title="forty hectares">a hundred
acres</span> of land covered with shallow water the last of October,
1902, just at the end of the dry season of the Cagayan Valley. The
surface was well covered with rank, coarse grasses and filled with
aquatic plants, especially with lilies. Apparently the waters were
slowly receding, since the earth about the margins was supporting the
short, coarse grasses that tell of the gradual drying out of soils once
covered with water. In the mountains near Sagada, Bontoc Province,
there is a very small lake, and one or two others have been reported at
Bontoc; but the mountains must be said to be practically lakeless.</p>
<p>Another mountain range of northern Luzon, of which practically no
details are known, is the Sierra Madre, extending nearly the full
length of the country close to the eastern coast. It seems to be an
unbroken, continuous range, and, as such, is the longest mountain range
in the Archipelago.</p>
<p>The fourth type of surface is the level areas. These areas lie
mainly along the river courses, and vary from <span class="measure"
title="10 to 15 meters">a few rods</span> in width to the valley
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1737" href="#xd21e1737" name=
"xd21e1737">26</a>]</span>of the Rio Grande de Cagayan, which is often
<span class="measure" title="80 kilometers">50 miles</span> in width,
and probably more. There are, besides these river valleys, varying
tracts of level plains which may most correctly be termed mountain
table-lands. The limited mountain valleys and table-lands are the
immediate home of the Igorot. The valleys are worn by the streams, and,
in turn, are built up, leveled, and enriched by the sand and alluvium
deposited annually by the floods. They are generally open,
grass-covered areas, though some have become densely forested since
being left above the high water of the streams.</p>
<p>The broad valley of the Rio Grande de Cagayan is not occupied by the
Igorot. It is too poorly watered and forested to meet his requirements.
It is mainly a vast pasture, supporting countless deer; along the
foothills and the forest-grown creek and river bottoms there are many
wild hogs; and in some areas herds of wild carabaos and horses are
found. Near the main river is a numerous population of Christians. Many
are Ilokano imported originally by the tobacco companies to carry on
the large tobacco plantations of the valley, and the others are the
native Cagayan.</p>
<p>The table-lands were once generally forested, but to-day many are
deforested, undulating, beautiful pastures. Some were cleared by the
Igorot for agriculture, and doubtless others by forest fires, such as
one constantly sees during the dry season destroying the mountain
forests of northern Luzon.</p>
<p>General observations have not been made on the temperature and
humidity of much of the mountain country of northern Luzon. However,
scientific observations have been made and recorded for a series of
about ten years at Baguio, Benguet Province, at an altitude of
<span class="measure" title="1,456 meters">4,777 feet</span>, and it is
from the published data there gathered that the following facts are
gained.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1751src" href="#xd21e1751" name=

<p>It is seen that April is the hottest month of the year and February
is the coldest. The absolute lowest temperature recorded is
<span class="measure" title="5.61&deg; Celsius">42.10&deg;
Fahrenheit</span>, noted February 18, 1902. Of course the temperature
varies considerably&mdash;a fact due largely to altitude and prevailing
winds. The height of the rainy season is in August, during which it
rains every day, with an average precipitation of <span class="measure"
title="94.06 centimeters">37.03 inches</span>. Baguio is known as much
rainier than many other places in the Cordillera Central, yet it must
be taken as more or less typical of the entire mountain area of
northern Luzon, throughout which the rainy season is very uniform.
Usually the days of the rainy season are beautiful and clear during the
forenoon, but all-day rains are not rare, and each season has two or
three storms of pelting, driving rain which continues without a break
for four or five days.</p>

<h3 class="main">Igorot peoples</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In several languages of northern Luzon the word
&ldquo;&#300;g-o-rot&prime;&rdquo; means &ldquo;mountain people.&rdquo;
Dr. Pardo de Tavera says the word &ldquo;Igorrote&rdquo; is composed of
the root word &ldquo;golot,&rdquo; meaning, in Tagalog, &ldquo;mountain
chain,&rdquo; and the prefix &ldquo;i,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;dweller
in&rdquo; or &ldquo;people of.&rdquo; Morga in 1609 used the word as
&ldquo;Igolot;&rdquo; early Spaniards also used the word frequently as
&ldquo;Ygolotes&rdquo;&mdash;and to-day some groups of the Igorot, as
the Bontoc group, do not pronounce the &ldquo;r&rdquo; sound, which
common usage now puts in the word. The Spaniards applied the term to
the wild peoples of present Benguet and Lepanto Provinces, now a
short-haired, peaceful people. In after years its common application
spread eastward to the natives of the comandancia of Quiangan, in the
present Province of Nueva Vizcaya, and northward to those of
Bontoc.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;&#300;g-o-rot&prime;&rdquo; is now adopted
tentatively as the name of the extensive primitive Malayan people of
northern Luzon, because it is applied to a very large number of the
mountain people by themselves and also has a recognized usage in
ethnologic and other writings. Its form as
&ldquo;&#300;g-o-rot&prime;&rdquo; is adopted for both singular and
plural, because it is both natural and phonetic, and, because, so far
as it is possible to do so, it is thought wise to retain the simple
native forms of such words as it seems necessary or best to incorporate
in our language, especially in scientific language.</p>
<p>The sixteenth degree of north latitude cuts across Luzon probably as
far south as any people of the Igorot group are now located. It is
believed they occupy all the mountain country northward in the island
except the territory of the Ibilao in the southeastern part of the area
and some of the most inaccessible mountains in eastern Luzon, which are
occupied by Negritos.</p>
<p>There are from 150,000 to 225,000 Igorot in Igorot land. The census
of the Archipelago taken in 1903 will give the number as about 185,000.
In the northern part of Pangasinan Province, the southwestern part of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1929" href="#xd21e1929" name=
"xd21e1929">28</a>]</span>the territory, there are reported about 3,150
pagan people under various local names, as &ldquo;Igorrotes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Infieles&rdquo; [pagans], and &ldquo;Nuevos Christianos.&rdquo;
In Benguet Province there are some 23,000, commonly known as
&ldquo;Benguet Igorrotes.&rdquo; In Union Province there are about
4,400 primitive people, generally called &ldquo;Igorrotes.&rdquo;
Ilokos Sur has nearly 8,000, half of whom are known to history as
&ldquo;Tinguianes&rdquo; and half as &ldquo;Igorrotes.&rdquo; The
Province of Ilokos Norte has nearly 9,000, which number is divided
quite evenly between &ldquo;Igorrotes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tinguianes,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Infieles.&rdquo; Abra Province has in round numbers 13,500
pagan Malayans, most of whom are historically known as
&ldquo;Alzados&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tinguianes.&rdquo; These Tinguian
ethnically belong to the great Igorot group, and in northern Bontoc
Province, where they are known as Itneg, flow into and are not
distinguishable from the Igorot; but no effort is made in this
monograph to cut the Tinguian asunder from the position they have
gained in historic and ethnologic writings as a separate people. The
Province of Lepanto-Bontoc has, according to records, about 70,500
&ldquo;Igorrotes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tinguianes,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Caylingas,&rdquo; but I believe a more careful census will show
it has nearer 100,000. Nueva Ecija is reported to have half a hundred
&ldquo;Tinguianes.&rdquo; The Province of Nueva Vizcaya has some 46,000
people locally and historically known as &ldquo;Bunnayans,&rdquo; a
large group in the Spanish comandancia of Quiangan; the
&ldquo;Silapanes,&rdquo; also a large group of people closely
associated with the Bunayan; the Isinay, a small group in the southern
part of the province; the Alamit, a considerable group of Silipan
people dwelling along the Alamit River in the comandancia of Quiangan;
and the small Ayangan group of the Bunayan people of Quiangan. Cagayan
Province has about 11,000 &ldquo;Caylingas&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ipuyaos.&rdquo; Isabela Province is reported as having about
2,700 primitive Malayans of the Igorot group; they are historically
known as &ldquo;Igorrotes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gaddanes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Calingas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ifugaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following forms of the above names of different dialect groups
of &#300;g-o-rot&prime; have been adopted by The Ethnological Survey:
T&#301;n-gui-an&prime;, Ka-l&#301;n&prime;-ga, Bun-a-yan&prime;,
I-sa-nay&prime;, A-la&prime;-m&#301;t, S&#301;l-i-pan&prime;,
Ay-an&prime;-gan, &#300;-pu-kao&prime;, and Gad-an&prime;.</p>
<p>It is believed that all the mountain people of the northern half of
Luzon, except the Negritos, came to the island in some of the earliest
of the movements that swept the coasts of the Archipelago from the
south and spread over the inland areas&mdash;succeeding waves of
people, having more culture, driving their cruder blood fellows farther
inland. Though originally of one blood, and though they are all to-day
in a similar broad culture-grade&mdash;that is, all are mountain
agriculturists, and all are, or until recently have been,
head-hunters&mdash;yet it does not follow that the Igorot groups have
to-day identical culture; quite the contrary is true. There are many
and wide differences even in important cultural expressions which are
due to environment, long isolation, and in some cases to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1935" href="#xd21e1935" name=
"xd21e1935">29</a>]</span>ideas and processes borrowed from different
neighboring peoples. Very misleading statements have sometimes been
made in regard to the Igorot&mdash;customs from different groups have
been jumbled together in one description until a man has been pictured
who can not be found anywhere. All except the most general statements
are worse than wasted unless a particular group is designated.</p>
<p>An illustration of some of the differences between groups of typical
Igorot will make this clearer. I select as examples the people of
Bontoc and the adjoining Quiangan district in northern Nueva Vizcaya
Province, both of whom are commonly known as Igorot. It must be noted
that the people of both areas are practically unmodified by modern
culture and both are constant head-hunters. With scarcely one exception
Bontoc pueblos are single clusters of buildings; in Banawi pueblo of
the Quiangan area there are eleven separate groups of dwellings, each
group situated on a prominence which may be easily protected by the
inhabitants against an enemy below them; and other Quiangan pueblos are
similarly built. As will be brought out in succeeding chapters, the
social and political institutions of the two peoples differ widely. In
Bontoc the head weapon is a battle-ax, in Quiangan it is a long knife.
Most of the head-hunting practices of the two peoples are different,
especially as to the disposition of the skulls of the victims. Bontoc
men wear their hair long, and have developed a small pocket-hat to
confine the hair and contain small objects carried about; the men of
Quiangan wear their hair short, have nothing whatever of the nature of
the pocket-hat, but have developed a unique hand bag which is used as a
pocket. In the Quiangan area a highly conventionalized wood-carving art
has developed&mdash;beautiful eating spoons with figures of men and
women carved on the handles and food bowls cut in animal figures are
everywhere found; while in Bontoc only the most crude and artless wood
carving is made. In language there is such a difference that Bontoc men
who accompanied me into the northern part of the large Quiangan area,
only a long day from Bontoc pueblo, could not converse with Quiangan
men, even about such common things as travelers in a strange territory
need to learn.</p>
<p>It is because of the many differences in cultural expressions
between even small and neighboring communities of the primitive people
of the Philippine Archipelago that I wish to be understood in this
paper as speaking of the one group&mdash;the Bontoc Igorot culture
group; a group however, in every essential typical of the numerous
Igorot peoples of the mountains of northern Luzon. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc culture area nearly equals the old Spanish
Distrito Politico-Militar of Bontoc, presented to the American public
in a Government publication in 1900.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1950src" href="#xd21e1950" name="xd21e1950src">1</a></p>
<p>The Spanish Bontoc area was estimated about 4,500 square kilometers.
This was probably too large an estimate, and it is undoubtedly an
overestimate for the Bontoc culture area, the northern border of which
is farther south than the border of the Spanish Bontoc area.</p>
<p>The area is well in the center of northern Luzon and is cut off by
watersheds from other territory, except on the northeast. The most
prominent of these watersheds is Polis Mountain, extending along the
eastern and southern sides of the area; it is supposed to reach a
height of over <span class="measure" title="2,130 meters">7,000
feet</span>. The western watershed is an undifferentiated range of the
Cordillera Central. To the north stretches a large area of the present
Province of Bontoc, though until 1903 most of that northern territory
was embraced in the Province of Abra. The Province of Isabela lies to
the east; Nueva Vizcaya and Lepanto border the area on the south, and
Lepanto and Abra border it on the west.</p>
<p>The Bontoc culture area lies entirely in the mountains, and, with
the exception of two pueblos, it is all drained northeastward into the
Rio Grande de Cagayan by one river, the Rio Chico de Cagayan; but the
Rio Sibbu, coursing more directly eastward, is a considerable
stream.</p>
<p>To-day one main trail enters Bontoc Province. It was originally
built by the Spaniards, and enters Bontoc pueblo from the southwest,
leading up from Cervantes in Lepanto Province. From Cervantes there are
two trails to the coast. One passes southward through Baguio in Benguet
Province and then stretches westward, terminating on the coast at San
Fernando, in Union Province. The other, the one most commonly traveled
to Bontoc, passes to the northwest, terminating on the coast at Candon,
in the Province of Ilokos Sur. The main trail, entering Bontoc
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1964" href="#xd21e1964" name=
"xd21e1964">31</a>]</span>from Cervantes, passes through the pueblo and
extends to the northeast, quite closely following the trend of the
Chico River. In Spanish times it was seldom traveled farther than
Bassao, but several parties of Americans have been over it as far as
the Rio Grande de Cagayan since November, 1902. A second trail, also of
Spanish origin, but now practically unused, enters the area from the
south and connects Bontoc pueblo, its northern terminus, with the
valley of the Magat River far south. It passes through the pueblos of
Bayambang, Quiangan, and Banawi, in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya.</p>
<p>The main trail is to-day passable for a horseman from the coast
terminus to Tinglayan, three days beyond Bontoc pueblo. Practically all
other trails in the area are simply wild footpaths of the Igorot.
Candon, the coast terminus of the main trail, lies in the coastal plain
area about <span class="measure" title="7 kilometers">4&frac14;
miles</span> from the sea. From the coast to the small pueblo of
Concepcion at the western base of the Cordillera Central is a
half-day&rsquo;s journey. The first half of the trail passes over flat
land, with here and there small pueblos surrounded by rice sementeras.
There are almost no forests. The latter half is through the coastal
hill area, and the trail frequently passes through small forests; it
crosses several rivers, dangerous to ford in the rainy season, and
winds in and out among attractive hills bearing clumps of graceful,
plume-like bamboo.</p>
<p>From Concepcion the trail leads up the mountain to Tilud Pass,
historic since the insurrection because of the brave stand made there
by the young, ill-fated General del Pilar. The climb to Tilud Pass,
from either side of the mountain, is one of the longest and most
tedious in northern Luzon. The trail frequently turns short on itself,
so that the front and rear parts of a pack train are traveling face to
face, and one end is not more than <span class="measure" title=
"40 or 50 meters">eight or ten rods</span> above the other on the side
of the mountain. The last view of the sea from the Candon-Bontoc trail
is obtained at Tilud Pass. From Concepcion to Angaki, at the base of
the mountain on the eastern side of the pass, the trail is about half a
day long. From the pass it is a ceaseless drop down the steep mountain,
but affords the most charming views of mountain scenery in northern
Luzon. The shifting direction of the turning trail and the various
altitudes of the traveler present constantly changing
scenes&mdash;mountains and mountains ramble on before one. From Angaki
to Cervantes the trail passes over deforested rolling mountain land,
with safe drinking water in only one small spring. Many travelers who
pass that part of the journey in the middle of the day complain loudly
of the heat and thirst experienced there.</p>
<p>Cervantes, said to be <span class="measure" title=
"113 kilometers">70 miles</span> from Candon, is the capital of the
dual Province of Lepanto-Bontoc. Bontoc pueblo lies inland only about
<span class="measure" title="56 kilometers">35 miles</span> farther,
but the greater part of two days is usually required to reach it.
Twenty minutes will carry a horseman down the bluff from Cervantes,
across the swift Abra&mdash;if the stream is fordable&mdash;and start
him on the eastward mountain climb. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1984" href="#xd21e1984" name="xd21e1984">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first pueblo beyond Cervantes is Cayan, the old Spanish capital
of the district. About twenty-five years ago the site was changed from
Cayan to Cervantes because there was not sufficient suitable land at
Cayan. Cayan is about four hours from Cervantes, and every <span class=
"measure" title="meter">foot</span> of the trail is up the mountain. A
short distance beyond Cayan the trail divides to rejoin only at the
outskirts of Bontoc pueblo; but the right-hand or &ldquo;lower&rdquo;
trail is not often traveled by horsemen. Up and up the mountain one
climbs from about <span class="measure" title="550 meters">1,800
feet</span> at Cervantes to about <span class="measure" title=
"1,800 meters">6,000 feet</span> among the pines, and then slowly
descends, having crossed the boundary line between Lepanto and Bontoc
subprovinces to the pueblo of Bagnen&mdash;the last one before the
Bontoc culture area is entered. It is customary to spend the night on
the trail, as one goes into Bontoc, either at Bagnen or at Sagada, a
pueblo about two hours farther on.</p>
<p>Only along the top of the high mountain, before Bagnen is reached,
does the trail pass through a forest&mdash;otherwise it is always
climbing up or winding about the mountains deforested probably by
fires. Practically all the immediate territory on the right hand of the
trail between Bagnen and Sagada is occupied by the beautifully terraced
rice sementeras of Balugan; the valley contains more than <span class=
"measure" title="four hundred hectares">a thousand acres</span> so
cultivated. At Sagada lime rocks&mdash;some eroded into gigantic,
massive forms, others into fantastic spires and domes&mdash;everywhere
crop out from the grassy hills. Up and down the mountains the trail
leads, passing another small pine forest near Ankiling and Titipan,
about four hours from Bontoc, and then creeps on and at last through
the terraced entrance way into the mountain pocket where Bontoc pueblo
lies, about <span class="measure" title="160 kilometers">100
miles</span> from the western coast, and, by Government aneroid
barometer, about <span class="measure" title="850 meters">2,800
feet</span> above the sea.</p>

<h3 class="main">Marks of Bontoc culture</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is difficult and often impossible to state the
essential difference in culture which distinguishes one group of people
from another. It is more difficult to draw lines of distinction, for
the culture of one group almost imperceptibly flows into that of
another adjoining it.</p>
<p>However, two fundamental institutions of the people of Bontoc seem
to differ from those of most adjoining people. One of these
institutions has to do with the control of the pueblo. Bontoc has not
developed the headman&mdash;the &ldquo;principal&rdquo; of the
Spaniard, the &ldquo;Bak-nan&prime;&rdquo; of the Benguet
Igorot&mdash;the one rich man who becomes the pueblo, leader. In
Benguet Province the headman is found in every pueblo, and he is so
powerful that he often dominates half a dozen outlying barrios to the
extent that he receives a large share, often one-half, of the output of
all the productive labors of the barrio. Immediately north of the
Bontoc area, in Tinglayan, the headman is again found. He has no place
whatever in Bontoc. The control of the pueblos of the Bontoc area is in
the hands of groups of old men; however, each group, called
&ldquo;intugtukan,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2014"
href="#xd21e2014" name="xd21e2014">33</a>]</span>operates only within a
single political and geographic portion of the pueblo, so that no one
group has in charge the control of the pueblo. The pueblo is a loose
federation of smaller political groups.</p>
<p>The other institution is a social development. It is the olag, an
institution of trial marriage. It is not known to exist among adjoining
people, but is found throughout the area in which the intugtukan
exists; they are apparently coextensive. I was repeatedly informed that
the olag is not found in the Banawi area south of Bontoc, or in the
Tinglayan area east, or among the Tinguian to the north, or in Benguet
far southwest, or in Lepanto immediately southwest&mdash;though I have
some reason to believe that both the intugtukan and olag exist in a
crumbling way among certain Lepanto Igorot.</p>
<p>Besides these two institutions there are other differing marks of
culture between the Bontoc area and adjoining people. Some of these
were suggested a few pages back, others will appear in following
pages.</p>
<p>Without doubt the limits of the spread of the common culture have
been determined mainly by the physiography of the country. One of the
two pueblos in the area not on the common drainage system is Lias, but
Lias was largely built by a migration from Bontoc pueblo&mdash;the
hotbed of Bontoc culture. Barlig, the other pueblo not on the common
drainage system (both Barlig and Lias are on the Sibbu River), lies
between Lias and the other pueblos of the Bontoc culture area, and so
naturally has been drawn in line and held in line with the culture of
the geographic area in which it is located&mdash;its institutions are
those of its environment.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc Igorot has been in Bontoc longer than the
endurance of tradition, for he says he never lived elsewhere, that he
never drove any people out before him, and that he was never driven;
and has always called himself the &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#300;-pu-kao&prime;</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#300;-fu-gao&prime;</span>&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This word for people survives not only throughout the Province of
Bontoc but also far toward the northern end of Luzon, where it appears
as &ldquo;Apayao&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yaos.&rdquo; Bontoc designates the
people of the Quiangan region as &ldquo;&#300;-fu-gao&prime;,&rdquo;
though a part of them at least have a different name for
themselves.</p>
<p>The Bontoc Igorot have their center in the pueblo of Bontoc,
pronounced &ldquo;<span lang="bo">Ban-t&acirc;k&prime;</span>,&rdquo; a
Spanish corruption of the Igorot name &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">Fun-t&acirc;k&prime;</span>,&rdquo; a common native word for
mountain, the original name of the pueblo. To the northwest their
culture extends to that of the historic Tinguian, a long-haired folk
physiographically cut off by a watershed. To the east of the Cordillera
Central the Tinguian call themselves &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#300;t-n&#277;g&prime;</span>.&rdquo; To the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2049" href="#xd21e2049" name=
"xd21e2049">34</a>]</span>northeast the Bontoc culture area embraces
the pueblo of Basao, stopping short of Tinglayan. The eastern limit of
Bontoc culture is fixed by the pueblos of Lias and Barlig, and is thus
about coextensive with the province. Southward the area includes all to
the top of the watershed of Polis Mountain, which turns southward the
numerous streams feeding the Rio Magat. The pueblos south of this
watershed&mdash;Lubong, Gisang, Banawi, etc.&mdash;belong to the
short-haired people of Quiangan culture. To the west Bontoc culture
extends to the watershed of the Cordillera Central, which turns
westward the various affluents of the Rio del Abra. On the southwest
this cuts off the short-haired Lepanto Igorot, whose culture seems to
be more allied to that of Benguet than Bontoc.</p>
<p>The men of the Bontoc area know none of the peoples by whom they are
surrounded by the names history gives or the peoples designate
themselves, with the exception of the Lepanto Igorot, the <span lang=
"bo">&#300;t-n&#277;g&prime;</span>, and the Ilokano of the west coast.
They do not know the &ldquo;Tinguian&rdquo; of Abra on their north and
northwest by that name; they call them &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#300;t-n&#277;g&prime;</span>.&rdquo; Farther north are the
people called by the Spaniards &ldquo;Nabayuganes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aripas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ipugaos;&rdquo; to the northeast and
east are the &ldquo;Caylingas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Comunanges,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bayabonanes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dayags,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gaddannes&rdquo;&mdash;but Bontoc knows none of these names.
Bontoc culture and Kalinga culture lie close together on the east, and
the people of Bontoc pueblo name all their eastern neighbors
<span lang="bo">&#300;t-n&#277;g&prime;</span>&mdash;the same term they
apply to the Tinguian to the west and northwest, because, they say,
they all wear great quantities of brass on the arms and legs. To the
south of Bontoc are the Quiangan Igorot, the Banawi division of which,
at least, names itself <span lang="bo">May&prime;-yo-y&#277;t</span>,
but whom Bontoc calls &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#300;-fu-gao&prime;</span>.&rdquo; They designate the people of
Benguet the &ldquo;Igorot of Benguet,&rdquo; but these peoples
designate themselves &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#300;b-a-loi&prime;</span>&rdquo; in the northern part, and
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">Kan-ka-nay&prime;</span>&rdquo; in the southern
part, neither of which names Bontoc knows.</p>
<p>She has still another set of names for the people surrounding
her&mdash;people whom she vaguely knows are there but of whom or of
whose lands she has no first-hand knowledge. The people to the north
are &ldquo;<span lang="bo">Am-yan&prime;-an</span>,&rdquo; and the
northern country is &ldquo;<span lang="bo">La&prime;-god</span>.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;<span lang="bo">Day&prime;-ya</span>&rdquo; are the eastern
people, while &ldquo;<span lang="bo">Bar&prime;-l&#301;g</span>&rdquo;
is the name of the eastern and southeastern land. &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">Ab-a-ga&prime;-tan</span>&rdquo; are the people of the south, and
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">Fi&prime;-l&#301;g
ab-a-ga&prime;-tan</span>,&rdquo; is the south land. The people of the
west are &ldquo;<span lang="bo">Loa&prime;-od</span>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">Fi&prime;-l&#301;g lao&prime;-od</span>,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<span lang="bo">Lo&prime;-ko</span>&rdquo; (the Provinces of
Ilokos Norte and Ilokos Sur) is the country lying to the west and
southwest.</p>
<p>Some of the old men of Bontoc say that in the past the Igorot people
once extended to the seacoast in the Provinces of Ilokos Norte and
Ilokos Sur. This, of course, is a tradition of the prehistoric time
before the Ilokano invaded northern Luzon; but, as has been stated, the
Bontoc people claim never to have been driven by that invasion, neither
have they any knowledge of such a movement. It is not improbable,
however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2107" href="#xd21e2107"
name="xd21e2107">35</a>]</span>that traditions of the invasion may
linger with the people nearer the coast and farther north.</p>

<h4 class="main">Historical sketch</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is regretted that the once voluminous historical
records and data which the Spaniards prepared and kept at Bontoc were
burned&mdash;tons of paper, they say&mdash;probably late in 1898 or
early in 1899 by Captain Angels, an insurrecto. However, from scanty
printed historical data, but mostly from information gathered in Bontoc
from Igorot and resident Ilokano, the following brief sketch is
presented, with the hope that it will show the nature of the outside
influences which have been about Bontoc for the past half century prior
to American occupation. It is believed that the data are sufficiently
truthful for this purpose, but no claim is made for historical
accuracy.</p>
<p>It seems that in 1665 the Spanish governor of the Philippines,
Governor-General D. Diego de Salcedo, sent an expedition from Manila
into northern Luzon. Some time during the three years the expedition
was out its influence was felt in Fidelisan and Tanolang, two pueblos
in the western part of the Bontoc culture area, for history says they
paid tribute.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2116src" href="#xd21e2116"
name="xd21e2116src">2</a> It is not probable that any considerable
party from the expedition penetrated the Igorot mountain country as far
as the above pueblos.</p>
<p>After the year 1700 expeditions occasionally reached Cayan, which,
until about twenty-five years ago, as has been stated, was a Spanish
capital. In 1852 the entire territory of present Lepanto-Bontoc and a
large part of northern Nueva Vizcaya were organized as an independent
&ldquo;distrito,&rdquo; under the name of &ldquo;Valle de
Cayan;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2121src" href="#xd21e2121"
name="xd21e2121src">3</a> and a few years later, though the author does
not give the date, Bontoc was established as an independent
&ldquo;distrito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spaniards and Ilokano in and about Bontoc Province say that it
was about fifty years ago that the Spaniards first came to Bontoc. The
time agrees very accurately with the time of the establishment of the
district. From then until 1899 there was a Spanish garrison of 200 or
300 men stationed in Bontoc pueblo. Christian Ilokano from the west
coast of northern Luzon and the Christian Tagalog from Manila and
vicinity were the soldiers.</p>
<p>The Spanish comandante of the &ldquo;distrito,&rdquo; the head of
the political-military government, resided there, and there were also a
few Spanish army officers and an army chaplain. A large garrison was
quartered in Cervantes; there was a church in both Bontoc and
Cervantes. In the district of Bontoc there was a Spanish post at
Sagada, between the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2128" href=
"#xd21e2128" name="xd21e2128">36</a>]</span>two capitals, Bontoc and
Cervantes. Farther to the east was a post at Tukukan and Sakasakan, and
farther east, at Basao, there was a post, a church, and a priest.</p>
<p>Most of the pueblos had Ilokano presidentes. The Igorot say that the
Spaniards did little for them except to shoot them. There is yet a
long, heavy wooden stock in Bontoc pueblo in which the Igorot were
imprisoned. Igorot women were made the mistresses of both officers and
soldiers. Work, food, fuel, and lumber were not always paid for. All
persons 18 or more years old were required to pay an annual tax of 50
cents or an equivalent value in rice. A day&rsquo;s wage was only 5
cents, so each family was required to pay an equivalent of twenty
days&rsquo; labor annually. In wild towns the principal men were told
to bring in so many thousand bunches of palay&mdash;the unthreshed
rice. If it was not all brought in, the soldiers frequently went for
it, accompanied by Igorot warriors; they gathered up the rice, and
sometimes burned the entire pueblo. Apad, the principal man of
Tinglayan, was confined six years in Spanish jails at Bontoc and Vigan
because he repeatedly failed to compel his people to bring in the
amount of palay assessed them.</p>
<p>They say there were three small guardhouses on the outskirts of
Bontoc pueblo, and armed Igorot from an outside town were not allowed
to enter. They were disarmed, and came and went under guard.</p>
<p>The Spanish comandantes in charge of the province seem to have
remained only about two years each. Saldero was the last one. Early in
the eighties of the nineteenth century the comandante took his command
to Barlig, a day east of Bontoc, to punish that town because it had
killed people in Tulubin and Samoki; Barlig all but exterminated the
command&mdash;only three men escaped to tell the tale. Mandicota, a
Spanish officer, went from Manila with a battalion of 1,000 soldiers to
erase Barlig from the map; he was also accompanied from Bontoc by 800
warriors from that vicinity. The Barlig people fled to the mountains,
losing only seven men, whose heads the Bontoc Igorot cut off and
brought home.</p>
<p>Comandante Villameres is reported to have taken twenty soldiers and
about 520 warriors of Bontoc and Samoki to punish Tukukan for killing a
Samoki woman; the warriors returned with three heads.</p>
<p>They say that in 1891 Comandante Alfaro took 40 soldiers and 1,000
warriors from the vicinity of Bontoc to Ankiling; sixty heads adorned
the triumphant return of the warriors.</p>
<p>In 1893 Nevas is said to have taken 100 soldiers and 500 warriors to
Sadanga; they brought back one head.</p>
<p>A few years later Saldero went to &ldquo;clear up&rdquo; rebellious
Sagada with soldiers and Igorot warriors; Bontoc reports that the
warriors returned with 100 heads.</p>
<p>The insurrectos appeared before Cervantes two or three months after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2150" href="#xd21e2150" name=
"xd21e2150">37</a>]</span>Saldero&rsquo;s bloody work in Sagada. The
Spanish garrison fled before the insurrectos; the Spanish civilians
went with them, taking their flocks and herds to Bontoc. A thousand
pesos was the price offered by the Igorot of Sagada to the insurrectos
for Saldero&rsquo;s head when the Philippine soldiers passed through
the pueblo; but Saldero made good his escape from Bontoc, and left the
country by boat from Vigan.</p>
<p>The Bontoc Igorot assisted the insurrectos in many ways when they
first came. About <span class="measure" title="3&frac14; kilometers">2
miles</span> west of Bontoc is a Spanish rifle pit, and there the
Spanish soldiers, now swelled to about 600 men, lay in wait for the
insurrectos. There on two hilltops an historic sham battle occurred.
The two forces were <span class="measure" title=
"about 1,500 meters">nearly a mile</span> apart, and at that distance
they exchanged rifle bullets three days. The Spaniards finally
surrendered, on condition of safe escort to the coast. For fifty years
they had conquered their enemy who were armed only with spear and ax;
but the insurrectos were armed with guns. However, the really hard
pressing came from the rear&mdash;there were still the ax and
spear&mdash;and few soldiers from cuartel or trench who tried to bring
food or water for the fighting men ever reported why they were
delayed.</p>
<p>The feeling of friendship between the Igorot and insurrectos was so
strong that when the insurrectos asked the Igorot to go to Manila to
fight the new enemy (the Americans), 400 warriors, armed only with
spear, battle-ax, and shield, went a three weeks&rsquo; journey to get
American heads. At Caloocan, just outside Manila, they met the American
Army early in February, 1899. They threw their spears, the Americans
fired their guns&mdash;&ldquo;which must be brothers to the
thunder,&rdquo; the Igorot said&mdash;and they let fall their remaining
weapons, and, panic stricken, started home. All but thirteen arrived in
safety. They are not ashamed of their defeat and retreat; they made a
mistake when they went to fight the Americans, and they were quick to
see it. They are largely blessed with the saving sense of humor, and
some of the warriors who were at Caloocan have been known to say that
they never stopped running until they arrived home.</p>
<p>When these men told their people in Bontoc what part they and the
insurrectos played in the fight against the Americans, the tension
between the Igorot and insurrectos was at its greatest. The insurrectos
were evidently worse than the Spaniards. They did all the things the
Spaniards had done, and more&mdash;they robbed through falsehood.
Consequently, insurrectos frequently lost their heads.</p>
<p>Major Marsh went through Bontoc close after Aguinaldo in December,
1899. The Igorot befriended the Americans; they brought them food and
guided them faithfully along the bewildering mountain trails when the
insurrectos split and scattered&mdash;anywhere, everywhere, fleeing
eastward, northward, southward, in the mountains.</p>
<p>When Major Marsh returned through Bontoc, after following
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2168" href="#xd21e2168" name=
"xd21e2168">38</a>]</span>Aguinaldo into the heart of the Quiangan
area, he left in the pueblo some sixty shoeless men under a volunteer
lieutenant. The lieutenant promptly appointed an Ilokano presidente,
vice-presidente, secretary, and police force in Bontoc and also in
Sagada, and when the soldiers left in a few weeks he gave seven guns to
the &ldquo;officials&rdquo; in Bontoc and two to those in Sagada. A
short time proved that those &ldquo;officials&rdquo; were untrustworthy
men; many were insurrectos who had dropped behind Aguinaldo. They
persecuted the Igorot even worse than had the insurrectos. They seemed
to have the American Army behind them&mdash;and the Igorot stood in awe
of American arms.</p>
<p>The crisis came. An Igorot obtained possession of one of the guns,
and the Ilokano chief of police was killed and his corporal
wounded.</p>
<p>This shooting, at the time apparently unpremeditated, but, in
reality, carefully planned and successfully executed, was the cause of
the arrival in Bontoc pueblo of the first American civilians. At that
time a party of twenty Americans was at Fidelisan, a long day northwest
of Bontoc; they were prospecting and sightseeing. The Ilokano sent
these men a letter, and the Igorot sent a messenger, begging them to
come to the help of the pueblo. Three men went on August 27, 1900; they
were Truman K. Hunt, M.D., Mr. Frank Finley, and Mr. Riley. The
disagreement was settled, and several Ilokano families left Bontoc
under the protection of Mr. Riley.</p>
<p>August 9, 1901, when the Board of Health for the Philippine Islands
was organized, Dr. Hunt, who had remained in Bontoc most of the
preceding year, was appointed &ldquo;superintendent of public
vaccination and inspection of infectious diseases for the Provinces of
Bontoc and Lepanto.&rdquo; He was stationed at Bontoc. About that time
another American civilian came to the province&mdash;Mr. Reuben H.
Morley, now secretary-treasurer of the Province of Nueva Vizcaya, who
lived nearly a year in Tulubin, two hours from Bontoc. December 14 Mr.
William F. Smith, an American teacher, was sent to Bontoc to open a
school.</p>
<p>Early in 1902 Constabulary inspectors, Lieutenants Louis A. Powless
and Ernest A. Eckman, also came. May 28, 1902, the Philippine
Commission organized the Province of Lepanto-Bontoc; on June 9 Dr. Hunt
was appointed lieutenant-governor of the province. May 1, 1903, Dr.
Hunt resigned and E. A. Wagar, M.D., became his successor.</p>
<p>The Spaniard was in Bontoc about fifty years. To summarize the
Spanish influence on the Igorot&mdash;and this includes any influence
which the Ilokano or Tagalog may have had since they came among the
people under Spanish protection&mdash;it is believed that no essential
institution of the Igorot has been weakened or vitiated to any
appreciable degree. No Igorot attended the school which the Spaniards
had in Bontoc; to-day not ten Igorot of the pueblo can make themselves
understood in Spanish about the commonest things around them. I fail to
detect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2181" href="#xd21e2181" name=
"xd21e2181">39</a>]</span>any occupation, method, or device of the
Igorot which the Spaniards&rsquo; influence improved; and <span class=
"corr" title="Not in source">the</span> Igorot flatly deny any such
influence.</p>
<p>The Spaniard put the institution of pueblo presidente pretty well
throughout the area now in province, but the presidente in no way
interferes with the routine life of the people&mdash;he is the
mouthpiece of the Government asking for labor and the daily necessities
of a nonproductive, resident foreign population.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tax&rdquo; levied was scarcely in the nature of a modern
tax; it was more the means taken by the Spaniard to secure his
necessary food. In no other way was the political life and organization
of the pueblo affected. In the realm of religion and spirit belief the
surface has scarcely been scratched. The only Igorot who became
Christians were the wives of some of the Christian natives who came in
with the Spaniard, mainly as soldiers. There are now eight or ten such
women, wives of the resident Ilokanos of Bontoc pueblo, but those whose
husbands left the pueblo have reverted to Igorot faith.</p>
<p>In the matter of war and head-hunting the effect of the Spaniard was
to intensify the natural instinct of the Igorot in and about Bontoc
pueblo. Nineteen men in twenty of Bontoc and Samoki have taken a human
head, and it has been seen under what conditions and influences some of
those heads were taken. An Igorot, whose confidence I believe I have,
an old man who represents the knowledge and wisdom of the people, told
me recently that if the Americans wanted the people of Bontoc to go out
against a pueblo they would gladly go; and he added, suggestively, that
when the Spaniards were there the old men had much better food than
now, for many hogs were killed in the celebration of war
expeditions&mdash;and the old men got the greater part of the meat. The
Igorot is a natural head-hunter, and his training for the last sixty
years seems to have done little more for him than whet this
appetite.</p>

<p class="first">The Bontoc men average about <span class="measure"
title="1.628 meters">5 feet 4&#8539; inches</span> in height, and have
the appearance of being taller than they are. Again and again one is
deceived by their height, and he repeatedly backs a <span class=

<span class="measure" title="1.83-meter">6-foot</span> American, vainly
expecting the stature of the brown man to equal that of the white.
Almost never does the Bontoc man appear heavy or thickset, as does his

<p>From these measurements it appears that the composite man&mdash;the
average of the combined measurements of thirty-two men&mdash;is
mesaticephalic. Among the thirty-two men the extremes of cephalic index
are 91.48 and 67.48. This first measurement is of a young man between
20 and 25 years of age. It stands far removed from other measurements,
the one nearest it being 86.78, that of a man about 60 years old. The
other extreme is 67.48, the measure of a young man between 25 and 30
years of age. Among the thirty-two men, nine are
brachycephalic&mdash;that is, their cephalic index is greater than 80;
twenty of the thirty-two are mesaticephalic, with cephalic index
between 75 and 80; and only three are dolichocephalic&mdash;that is,
the cephalic index is below 75.</p>
<p>The nasal indexes of the thirty-two men show that the Bontoc man has
the &ldquo;medium&rdquo; or mesorhine nose. They also show that one is
very extremely platyrhine, the index being 104.54, and one is very
leptorhine, being 58.18. Of the total, five are leptorhine&mdash;that
is, have the &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; nose with nasal index below 70.
Seventeen men are mesorhine, with the &ldquo;medium&rdquo; nose with
nasal index between 70 and 85; and ten are platyrhine&mdash;that is,
the noses are &ldquo;broad,&rdquo; with an index greater than 85.</p>
<p>The Bontoc men are never corpulent, and, with the exception of the
very old, they are seldom poor. During the period of a man&rsquo;s
prime he is usually muscled to an excellent symmetry. His neck, never
long, is well formed and strong and supports the head in erect
position. His shoulders are broad, even, and full muscled, and with
seeming ease carry transportation baskets laden with <span class=
"measure" title="30 to 45 kilograms">75 to 100 pounds</span>. His arms
are smoothly developed and are about the same relative length as the
American&rsquo;s. The hands are strong and short. The waist line is
firm and smaller than the shoulders or hips. The buttocks usually
appear heavy. His legs are generally straight; the thighs and calves
are those of a prime pedestrian accustomed to long and frequent walks.
The ankles are seldom thick; and the feet are broad and relatively
short, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2282" href="#xd21e2282" name=
"xd21e2282">41</a>]</span>and, almost without exception, are placed on
the ground straight ahead. He has the feet of a pedestrian&mdash;not
the inturned feet of the constant bearer of heavy burdens on the back
or the outturned feet of the man who sits or stands. The perfection of
muscular development of two-thirds of the men of Bontoc between the
ages of 25 and 30 would be the envy of the average college athlete in
the States.</p>
<p>In color the men are brown, though there is a wide range of tone
from a light brown with a strong saffron undertone to a very dark
brown&mdash;as near a bronze as can well be imagined. The sun has more
to do with the different color tones than has anything else, after
which habits of personal cleanliness play a very large r&ocirc;le.
There are men in the Bontoc Igorot Constabulary of an extremely
light-brown color, more saffron than brown, who have been wearing
clothing for only one year. During the year the diet of the men in the
Constabulary has been practically the same as that of their darker
brothers among whom they were enlisted only twelve months ago. All the
members of the Constabulary differ much more in color from the
unclothed men than the unclothed differ among themselves. Man after man
of these latter may pass under the eye without revealing a tint of
saffron, yet there are many who show it faintly. The natural Igorot
never washes himself clean. He washes frequently, but lacks the means
of cleansing the skin, and the dirtier he is the more bronze-like he
appears. At all times his face looks lighter and more saffron-tinted
than the remainder of his body. There are two reasons for
this&mdash;because the face is more often washed and because of its
contrast with the black hair of the head.</p>
<p>The hair of the head is black, straight, coarse, and relatively
abundant. It is worn long, frequently more than half way to the hips
from the shoulders. The front is &ldquo;banged&rdquo; low and square
across the forehead, cut with the battle-ax; this line of cut runs to
above and somewhat back of the ear, the hair of the scalp below it
being cut close to the head. When the men age, a few gray hairs appear,
and some old men have heads of uniform iron-gray color. I have never
seen a white-haired Igorot. A few of the old men have their hair
thinning on the crown, but a tendency to baldness is by no means the
rule.</p>
<p>Bontoc pueblo is no exception to the rule that every pueblo in the
Philippines has a few people with curly or wavy hair. I doubt whether
to-day an entire tribe of perfectly straight-haired primitive Malayan
people exists in the Archipelago. Fu-n&#301;t is a curly-haired Bontoc
man of about 45 years of age. Many people told me that his father and
also his grandfather were members of the pueblo and had curly hair. I
have never been able to find any hint at foreign or Negrito blood in
any of the several curly haired people in the Bontoc culture area whose
ancestors I have tried to discover.</p>
<p>The scanty growth of hair on the face of the Bontoc man is pulled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2295" href="#xd21e2295" name=
"xd21e2295">42</a>]</span>out. A small pebble and the thumb nail or the
blade of the battle-ax and the bulb of the thumb are frequently used as
forceps; they never cut the hair of the face. It is common to see men
of all ages with a very sparse growth of hair on the upper lip or chin,
and one of 50 years in Bontoc has a fairly heavy <span class="measure"
title="10-centimeter">4-inch</span> growth of gray hair on his chin and
throat; he is shown in <a href="#pl013">Pl. XIII</a>. Their bodies are
quite free from hair. There is none on the breast, and seldom any on
the legs. The pelvic growth is always pulled out by the unmarried. The
growth in the armpits is scant, but is not removed.</p>
<p>The iris of the eye is brown&mdash;often rimmed with a lighter or
darker ring. The brown of the iris ranges from nearly black to a soft
hazel brown. The cornea is frequently blotched with red or yellow. The
Malayan fold of the upper eyelid is seen in a large majority of the
men, the fold being so low that it hangs over and hides the roots of
the lashes. The lashes appear to grow from behind the lid rather than
from its rim.</p>
<p>The teeth are large and strong, and, whereas in old age they
frequently become few and discolored, during prime they are often white
and clean. The people never artificially stain the teeth, and, though
surrounded by betel-nut chewers with dark teeth or red-stained lips,
they do not use the betel.</p>
<p>Since the Igorot keeps no record of years, it is impossible to know
his age, but it is believed that sufficient comparative data have been
collected in Bontoc to make the following estimates reliable:</p>
<p>At the age of 20 a man seems hardly to have reached his physical
best; this he attains, however, before he is 25. By 35 he begins to
show the marks of age. By 45 most of the men are fast getting
&ldquo;old&rdquo;; their faces are seamed, their muscles losing form,
their carriage less erect, and the step slower. By 55 all are
old&mdash;most are bent and thin. Probably not over one or two in a
hundred mature men live to be 70 years old.</p>
<p>The following census taken from a Spanish manuscript found in
Quiangan, and written in 1894, may be taken as representative of an
average Igorot pueblo:</p>

<p>From this census it seems that the Magulang Igorot man is at his
prime between the ages of 30 and 40 years, and that the death rate for
men between the ages of 40 and 50 is nearly as great as the death rate
among children between 5 to 10 years of age, being 52.7 per cent.
Beyond the age of 50 collapse is sudden, since all the men more than 50
years old are less than half the number of those between the ages of 40
and 50 years.</p>

<p>These measurements show that the composite woman&mdash;the average
of the measurements of twenty-nine women&mdash;is mesaticephalic. The
extremes of cephalic index are 87.64 and 64.89; both are measurements
of women about 35 years of age. Of the twenty-nine women twelve are
brachycephalic; twelve are mesaticephalic; and five are
dolichocephalic.</p>
<p>The Bontoc woman has a &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; or mesorhine, nose, as
is shown by the above figures. Four of the twenty-nine women have the
&ldquo;narrow&rdquo; leptorhine nose with nasal index below 70; seven
have platyrhine or the &ldquo;broad&rdquo; nose with index greater than
85; while seventeen have the &ldquo;medium&rdquo; or mesorhine nose
with nasal index between 70 and 85. The broadest nose has an index of
97.56, and the narrowest an index of 58.53.</p>
<p>The women reach the age of maturity well prepared for its
responsibilities. They have more adipose tissue than the men, yet are
never fat. The head is carried erect, but with a certain
stiffness&mdash;often due, in part, no doubt, to shyness, and in part
to the fact that they carry all their burdens on their heads. I believe
the neck more often appears short than does the neck of the man. The
shoulders are broad, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2473" href=
"#xd21e2473" name="xd21e2473">44</a>]</span>flat across the back. The
breasts are large, full, and well supported. The hips are broad and
well set, and the waist (there is no natural waist line) is frequently
no smaller than the hips, though smaller than the shoulders. Their arms
are smooth and strong, and they throw stones as men do, with the
full-arm throw from the shoulder. Their hands are short and strong.
Their legs are almost invariably straight, but are probably more
frequently bowed at the knees than are the men&rsquo;s. The thighs are
sturdy and strong, and the calves not infrequently over-large. This
enlargement runs low down, so the ankles, never slender, very often
appear coarse and large. In consequence of this heavy lower leg, the
feet, short at best, usually look much too short. They are placed on
the ground straight ahead, though the tendency to inturned feet is
slightly more <span class="corr" title=
"Source: noticable">noticeable</span> than it is among the men.</p>
<p>Their carriage is a healthful one, though it is not always graceful,
since their long strides commonly give the prominent buttocks a jerky
movement. They prove the naturalness of that style of walking which, in
profile, shows the chest thrust forward and the buttocks backward; the
abdomen is in, and the shoulders do not swing as the strides are
made.</p>
<p>It can not be said that at base the color of the women&rsquo;s skin
differs from that of the men, but the saffron undertone is more
commonly seen than it is in the unclothed men. It shows on the shaded
parts of the body, and where the skin is distended, as on the breast
and about certain features of the face.</p>
<p>The hair of the head is like that of the man&rsquo;s; it is worn
long, and is twisted and wound about the head. It has a tendency to
fall out as age comes on, but does not seem thin on the head. The
tendency to gray hairs is apparently somewhat less than it is with the
men. The remainder of the body is exceptionally free from hair. The
growth in the armpits and the pelvic hair are always pulled out by the
unmarried, and a large per cent of the women do not allow it to grow
even in old age.</p>
<p>Their eyes are brown, varied as are those of the men, and with the
Malayan fold of the upper eyelid.</p>
<p>Their teeth are generally whiter and cleaner than are those of their
male companions, a condition due largely, probably, to the fact that
few of the women smoke.</p>
<p>They seem to reach maturity at about 17 or 18 years of age. The
first child is commonly born between the ages of 16 and 22. At 23 the
woman has certainly reached her prime. By 30 she is getting
&ldquo;old&rdquo;; before 45 the women are old, with flat, pendent
folds of skin where the breasts were. The entire front of the
body&mdash;in prime full, rounded, and smooth&mdash;has become flabby,
wrinkled, and folded. It is only a short time before collapse of the
tissue takes place in all parts of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2490" href="#xd21e2490" name="xd21e2490">45</a>]</span>body. An
old woman, say, at 50, is a mass of wrinkles from foot to forehead; the
arms and legs lose their plumpness, the skin is &ldquo;bagged&rdquo; at
the knees into half a dozen large folds; and the disappearance of
adipose tissue from the trunk-front, sides, and back&mdash;has left the
skin not only wrinkled but loose and flabby, folding over the girdle at
the waist.</p>
<p>The census of Magulang, page 42, should be again referred to, from
which it appears that the death rate among women is greater between the
ages of 40 and 50 years than it is with men, being 55.66 per cent. The
census shows also that there are relatively a larger number of old
women&mdash;that is, over 50 years old&mdash;than there are old
men.</p>

<h5 class="main">Child</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The death rate among children is large. Of fifteen
families in Bontoc, each having had three or more children, the death
rate up to the age of puberty was over 60 per cent. According to the
Magulang census the death rate of children from 5 to 10 years of age is
63.73 per cent.</p>
<p>The new-born babe is as light in color as the average American babe,
and is much less red, instead of which color there is the slightest
tint of saffron. As the babe lies naked on its mother&rsquo;s naked
breast the light color is most strikingly apparent by contrast. The
darker color, the brown, gradually comes, however, as the babe is
exposed to the sun and wind, until the child of a year or two carried
on its mother&rsquo;s back is practically one with the mother in
color.</p>
<p>Some of the babes, perhaps all, are born with an abundance of dark
hair on the head. A child&rsquo;s hair is never cut, except that from
about the age of 3 years the boy&rsquo;s hair is &ldquo;banged&rdquo;
across the forehead. Fully 30 per cent of children up to 5 or 6 years
of age have brown hair&mdash;due largely to fading, as the outer is
much lighter than the under hair. In rare cases the lighter brown hair
assumes a distinctly red cast, though a faded lifeless red. Before
puberty is reached, however, all children have glossy black hair.</p>
<p>The iris of a new-born babe is sometimes a blue brown; it is
decidedly a different brown from that of the adult or of the child of
five years. Most children have the Malayan fold of the eyelid; the
lower lid is often much straighter than it is on the average American.
When, in addition to these conditions, the outer corner of the eye is
higher than the inner, the eye is somewhat Mongolian in appearance.
About one-fifth of the children in Bontoc have this Mongolian-like eye,
though it is rarer among adults&mdash;a fact due, in part, apparently,
to the down curving and sagging of the lower lid as one&rsquo;s prime
is reached and passed.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s teeth are clean and white, and very generally
remain so until maturity.</p>
<p>The child from 1 to 3 years of age is plump and chubby; his front
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2510" href="#xd21e2510" name=
"xd21e2510">46</a>]</span>is full and rounded, but lacks the extra
abdominal development so common with the children of the lowlands, and
which has received from the American the popular name of &ldquo;banana
belly.&rdquo; By the age of 7 the child has lost its plump, rounded
form, which is never again had by the boys but is attained by the girls
again early in puberty. During these last half dozen years of childhood
all children are slender and agile and wonderfully attractive in their
naturalness. Both girls and boys reach puberty at a later time than
would be expected, though data can not be gathered to determine
accurately the age at puberty. All the Ilokano in Bontoc pueblo
consistently maintain that girls do not reach puberty until at least 16
and 17 years of age. Perhaps it is arrived at by 14 or 15, but I feel
certain it is not as early as 12 or 13&mdash;a condition one might
expect to find among people in the tropics.</p>

<div class="div4 subsubsection" id="xd21e2512">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main">Pathology</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most serious permanent physical affliction the
Bontoc Igorot suffers is blindness. Fully 2 per cent of the people both
of Bontoc and her sister pueblo, Samoki, are blind; probably 2 per cent
more are partially so. Bontoc has one blind boy only 3 years old, but I
know of no other blind children; and it is claimed that no babes are
born blind. There is one woman in Bontoc approaching 20 years of age
who is nearly blind, and whose mother and older sister are blind.
Blindness is very common among the old people, and seems to come on
with the general breaking down of the body.</p>
<p>A few of the people say their blindness is due to the smoke in their
dwellings. This doubtless has much to do with the infirmity, as their
private and public buildings are very smoky much of the time, and when
the nights are at all chilly a fire is built in their closed, low, and
chimneyless sleeping rooms. There are many persons with inflamed and
granulated eyelids whose vision is little or not at all
impaired&mdash;a forerunner of blindness probably often caused by
smoke.</p>
<p>Twenty per cent of the adults have abnormal feet. The most common
and most striking abnormality is that known as
&ldquo;fa&prime;-w&#301;ng&rdquo;; it is an inturning of the great toe.
Fa&prime;-w&#301;ng occurs in all stages from the slightest spreading
to that approximating forty-five <span class="corr" title=
"Source: degress">degrees</span>. It is found widely scattered among
the barefoot mountain tribes of northern Luzon. The people say it is
due to mountain climbing, and their explanation is probably correct, as
the great toe is used much as is a claw in securing a footing on the
slippery, steep trails during the rainy reason. Fa&prime;-w&#301;ng
occurs quite as commonly with women as with men, and in Ambuklao,
Benguet Province, I saw a boy of 8 or 9 years whose great toes were
spread half as much as those shown in <a href="#pl025">Pl. XXV</a>.
This deformity occurs on one or both feet, but generally on both if at
all.</p>
<p>An enlargement of the basal joint of the great toe, probably a
bunion, is also comparatively common. It is not improbable that it is
often <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2529" href="#xd21e2529" name=
"xd21e2529">47</a>]</span>caused by stone bruises, as such are of
frequent occurrence; they are sometimes very serious, laying a person
up ten days at a time.</p>
<p>The feet of adults who work in the water-filled rice paddies are
dry, seamed, and cracked on the bottoms. These &ldquo;rice-paddy
feet,&rdquo; called &ldquo;fung-as&prime;,&rdquo; are often so sore
that the person can not go on the trails for any considerable
distance.</p>
<p>I believe not 5 per cent of the people are without eruptions of the
skin. It is practically impossible to find an adult whose body is not
marked with shiny patches showing where large eruptions have been.
Babes of one or two months do not appear to have skin diseases, but
those of three and four are sometimes half covered with itching,
discharging eruptions. Babes under a year old, such as are most carried
on their mother&rsquo;s backs, are especially subject to a mass of
sores about the ankles; the skin disease is itch, called
ku&prime;-l&#301;d. I have seen babes of this age with sores
<span class="measure" title="two and a half centimeters">an inch</span>
across and <span class="measure" title="two centimeters">nearly an
inch</span> deep in their backs.</p>
<p>Relatively there are few large sores on the people such as boils and
ulcers, but a person may have a dozen or half a hundred itching
eruptions the size of a half pea scattered over his arms, legs, and
trunk. From these he habitually squeezes the pus onto his thumb nail,
and at once ignorantly cleans the nail on some other part of the body.
The general prevalence of this itch is largely due to the gregarious
life of the people&mdash;to the fact that the males lounge in public
quarters, and all, except married men and women, sleep in these same
quarters where the naked skin readily takes up virus left on the stone
seats and sleeping boards by an infected companion. In Banawi, in the
Quiangan culture area, a district having no public buildings, one can
scarcely find a trace of skin eruption.</p>
<p>There are two adult people in Samoki pueblo who are insane; one of
them at least is supposed to be affected by Lumawig, the Igorot god,
and is said, when he hallooes, as he does at times, to be calling to
Lumawig. Bontoc pueblo has a young woman and a girl of five or six
years of age who are imbecile. Those four people are practically
incapacitated from earning a living, and are cared for by their
immediate relatives. There are two adult deaf and dumb men in Bontoc
pueblo, but both are industrious and self-supporting.</p>
<p>Igorot badly injured in war or elsewhere are usually killed at their
own request. In May, 1903, a man from Maligkong was thrown to the earth
and rendered unconscious by a heavy timber he and several companions
brought to Bontoc for the school building. His companions immediately
told Captain Eckman to shoot him as he was &ldquo;no good.&rdquo; I can
not say whether it is customary for the Igorot to weed out those who
faint temporarily&mdash;as the fact just cited suggests; however, they
do not kill the feeble aged, and the presence of the insane and the
imbecile shows that weak members of the group are not always destroyed
voluntarily. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2547" href="#xd21e2547"

<h3 class="main">The pueblo</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bontoc and Samoki pueblos, in all essentials typical
of pueblos in the Bontoc area, lie in the mountains in a roughly
circular pocket called Pa-pas&prime;-kan. A perfect circle about
<span class="measure" title="1,600 meters">a mile</span> in diameter
might be described within the pocket. It is bisected fairly accurately
by the Chico River, coursing from the southwest to the northeast. Its
altitude ranges from about <span class="measure" title=
"840 meters">2,750 feet</span> at the river to <span class="measure"
title="880">2,900</span> at the upper edge of Bontoc pueblo, which is
close to the base of the mountain ridge at the west, while Samoki is
backed up against the opposite ridge to the southeast. The river flows
between the pueblos, though considerably closer to Samoki than to
Bontoc.</p>
<p>The horizon circumscribing this pocket is cut at the northeast,
where the river makes its exit, and lifting above this gap are two
ranges of mountains beyond. At the south-southeast there is another
cut, through which a small affluent pours into the main stream. At the
southwest the river enters the pocket, although no cut shows in the
horizon, as the stream bends abruptly and the farther range of
mountains folds close upon the near one.</p>
<p>Bontoc lies compactly built on a sloping piece of ground, roughly
about <span class="measure" title="800 meters square">half a mile
square</span>. Through the pueblo are two water-cut ravines, down which
pour the waters of the mountain ridge in the rainy season, and in
which, during much of the remainder of the year, sufficient water
trickles to supply several near-by dwellings.</p>
<p>Adjoining the pueblo on the north and west are two small groves
where a religious ceremonial is observed each month. Granaries for rice
are scattered all about the outer fringe of dwellings, and in places
they follow the ravines in among the buildings of the pueblo. The old,
broad Spanish trail runs close to the pueblo on the south and east, as
it passes in and out of the pocket through the gaps cut by the river.
About the pueblo at the east and northeast are some fifteen houses
built in Spanish time, most of them now occupied by Ilokano men with
Igorot or half-breed wives. There also were the Spanish Government
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2574" href="#xd21e2574" name=
"xd21e2574">49</a>]</span>buildings, reduced to a church, a convent,
and another building used now as headquarters for the Government
Constabulary.</p>
<p>The pueblo, now 2,000 or 2,500 people, was probably at one time
larger. There is a tradition common in both Bontoc and Samoki that in
former years the ancestors of this latter pueblo lived northeast of
Bontoc toward the northern corner of the pocket. They say they moved to
the opposite side of the river because there they would have more room.
There they have grown to 1,200 or 1,500 souls. Still later, but yet
before the Spanish came, a large section of people from northeastern
Bontoc moved bodily to Lias, about two days to the east. They tell that
a Bontoc woman named Fank&prime;-a was the wife of a Lias man, and when
a drought and famine visited Bontoc the section of the pueblo from
which she came moved as a whole to Lias, then a small collection of
people. Still later, La&prime;-nao, a detached section of Bontoc on the
lowland near the river, was suddenly wiped out by a disease.</p>
<p>The Igorot is given to naming even small areas of the earth within
his well-known habitat, and there are four areas in Bontoc pueblo
having distinct names. These names in no way refer to political or
social divisions&mdash;they are not the &ldquo;barrio&rdquo; of the
coast pueblos of the Islands, neither are they in any way like a
&ldquo;ward&rdquo; in an American city, nor are they
&ldquo;additions&rdquo; to an original part of the pueblo&mdash;they
are names of geographic areas over which the pueblo was built or has
spread. From south to north these areas are A-fu&prime;,
Mag-e&prime;-o, Dao&prime;-wi, and Um-f&#277;g&prime;.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e2580">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Ato</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bontoc is composed of seventeen political divisions,
called &ldquo;a&prime;-to.&rdquo; The geographic area of A-fu&prime;
contains four a&prime;-to, namely, Fa-tay&prime;-yan, Po-lup-o&prime;,
Am-ka&prime;-wa, and Bu-yay&prime;-y&#277;ng; Mag-e&prime;-o contains
three, namely, Fi&prime;-l&#301;g, Mag-e&prime;-o, and Cha-kong&prime;;
Dao&prime;-wi has six, namely, Lo-w&#301;ng&prime;-an,
Pud-pud-chog&prime;, Si-pa&prime;-at, Si-gi-chan&prime;,
So-mo-wan&prime;, and Long-foy&prime;; Um-f&#277;g&prime; has four,
Po-ki&prime;-san, Lu-wa&prime;-kan, Ung-kan&prime;, and Cho&prime;-ko.
Each a&prime;-to is a separate political division. It has its public
buildings; has a separate governing council which makes peace,
challenges to war, and accepts or rejects war challenges, and it
formally releases and adopts men who change residence from one
a&prime;-to to another.</p>
<p>Border a&prime;-to Fa-tay&prime;-yan seems to be developing an
offspring&mdash;a new a&prime;-to; a part of it, the southwestern
border part, is now known as &ldquo;Tang-e-ao&prime;.&rdquo; It is
disclaimed as a separate a&prime;-to, yet it has a distinctive name,
and possesses some of the marks of an independent a&prime;-to. In due
time it will doubtless become such.</p>
<p>In Sagada, Agawa, Takong, and near-by pueblos the a&prime;-to is
said to be known as dap&prime;-ay; and in Balili and Alap both names
are known.</p>
<p>The pueblo must be studied entirely through the a&prime;-to. It is
only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2591" href="#xd21e2591" name=
"xd21e2591">50</a>]</span>an aggregate of which the various a&prime;-to
are the units, and all the pueblo life there is is due to the
similarity of interests of the several a&prime;-to.</p>
<p>Bontoc does not know when her pueblo was built&mdash;she was always
where she now is&mdash;but they say that some of the a&prime;-to are
newer than others. In fact, they divide them into the old and new. The
newer ones are Bu-yay&prime;-y&#277;ng, Am-ka&prime;-wa,
Po-lup-o&prime;, Cha-kong&prime;, and Po-ki&prime;-san; all these are
border a&prime;-to of the pueblo.</p>
<p>The generations of descendants of men who did distinct things are
kept carefully in memory; and from the list of descendants of the
builders of some of the newer a&prime;-to it seems probable that
Cha-kong&prime; was the last one built. One of the builders was
Sal-lu-yud&prime;; he had a son named Tam-bul&prime;, and
Tam-bul&prime; was the father of a man in Bontoc now some twenty-five
years old. It is probable that Cha-kong&prime; was built about
1830&mdash;in the neighborhood of seventy-five years ago. The plat of
the pueblo seems to strengthen the impression that Cha-kong&prime; is
the newest a&prime;-to, since it appears to have been built in
territory previously used for rice granaries; it is all but surrounded
by such ground now.</p>
<p>One of the builders of Bu-yay&prime;-y&#277;ng, an a&prime;-to
adjoining Cha-kong&prime;, and also one of the newer ones, was
Ba-la-ge&prime;. Ba-la-ge&prime; was the great-great-great-grandfather
of Mud-do&prime;, who is a middle-aged man now in Bontoc. The
generations of fathers descending from Ba-la-ge&prime; to Mud-do&prime;
are the following: Bang-&#277;g&prime;, Cag-i&prime;-yu,
B&#301;t-e&prime;, and Ag-kus&prime;. It seems from this evidence that
the a&prime;-to Bu-yay&prime;-y&#277;ng was built about one hundred and
fifty years ago. These facts suggest a much greater age for the older
a&prime;-to of the pueblo.</p>
<p>An a&prime;-to has three classes of buildings occupied by the
people&mdash;the fawi and pabafunan, public structures for boys and
men, and the olag for girls and young women before their permanent
marriage; and the dwellings occupied by families and by widows, which
are called afong. Each of these three classes of buildings plays a
distinct r&ocirc;le in the life of the people.</p>

a&prime;-to ceremonials. It is sacred to the men of the a&prime;-to,
and on no occasion do the women or girls enter it.</p>
<p>All boys from 3 or 4 years of age and all men who have no wives
sleep nightly in the pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan or in the fa&prime;-wi.</p>
<p>The pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan building consists of a low, squat,
stone-sided structure partly covered with a grass roof laid on a crude
frame of poles; the stone walls extend beyond the roof at one end and
form an open court. The roofed part is about <span class="measure"
title="2&frac12; by 3 meters">8 by 10 feet</span>, and usually is not
over <span class="measure" title="1&frac12; meter">5 feet</span> high
in any part, inside measure; the size of the court is approximately the
same as that of the roofed section. In some pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan a part
of the court is roofed over for shelter in case of rain, but is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2619" href="#xd21e2619" name=
"xd21e2619">51</a>]</span>not walled in. Under this roof skulls of dogs
and hogs are generally found tucked away. Carabao horns and chicken
feathers are also commonly seen in such places.</p>
<p>In many cases the open court is shaded by a tree. Posts are found
reared above most of the courts. Some are old and blackened; others are
all but gone&mdash;a short stump being all that projects above the
earth. The tops of some posts are rudely carved to represent a human
head; on the tops of others, as in a&prime;-to Lowingan and Sipaat,
there are stones which strikingly resemble human skulls. It is to the
tops of these posts that the enemy&rsquo;s head is attached when a
victorious warrior returns to his a&prime;-to. Both the roofed and
court sections are paved with stone, and large stones are also arranged
around the sides of the court, some more or less elevated as seats;
they are worn smooth and shiny by generations of use. In the center of
the court is the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: smouldering">smoldering</span> remains of a fire. The only
opening into the covered part is a small doorway connecting it with the
court. This door is barely large enough to permit a man to squeeze in
sidewise; it is often not over <span class="measure" title=
"75 centimeters">2&frac12; feet</span> high and <span class="measure"
title="25 centimeters">10 inches</span> wide. The occupants of the
pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan usually sleep curled up naked on the smooth, flat
stones. A few people have runo slat mats, some of which roll up, while
others are inflexible, and they lie on these over the stone pavement.
Fires are built in all sleeping rooms when it is cold, and the rooms
all close tightly with a door.</p>
<p>In the court of the building the men lounge when not at work in the
fields; they sleep, or smoke and chat, tend babies, or make utensils
and weapons. The pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan is the man&rsquo;s club by day,
and the unmarried man&rsquo;s dormitory by night, and, as such, it is
the social center for all men of the a&prime;-to, and it harbors at
night all men visiting from other pueblos.</p>
<p>Each a&prime;-to, except Chakong, has a pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan. When
the men of Chakong were building theirs they met the pueblo of Sadanga
in combat, and one of the builders lost his head to Sadanga. Then the
old men of Chakong counciled together; they came to the conclusion that
it was bad for the a&prime;-to to have a pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan, and none
has ever been built. This absence of the pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan in some
way detracts from the importance of the a&prime;-to in the minds of the
people. For instance, in the early stages of this study I was told
several times that there are sixteen (and not seventeen) a&prime;-to in
Bontoc. The first list of a&prime;-to written did not include Chakong;
it was discovered only when the pueblo was platted, and at that time my
informants sought to pass it over by saying &ldquo;It is Chakong, but
it has no pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan.&rdquo; The explanation of the obscurity
of Chakong in the minds of the Igorot seems to be that the a&prime;-to
ceremonial is more important than the a&prime;-to council&mdash;that
the emotional and not the mental is held uppermost, that the people of
Bontoc flow together through feeling better than they drive together
through cold force or control. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2639"
href="#xd21e2639" name="xd21e2639">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>The a&prime;-to ceremonials of Chakong are held in the
pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan of neighboring a&prime;-to, as in Sigichan,
Pudpudchog, or Filig, and this seems partially to destroy the <i>esprit
de corps</i> of the unfortunate a&prime;-to.</p>
<p>Each <span class="corr" title=
"Source: a&prime;to">a&prime;-to</span> has a fa&prime;-wi
building&mdash;a structure greatly resembling to the
pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan, and impossible to be distinguished from it by one
looking at the structure from the outside. The fa&prime;-wi and
pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan are shown in <a href="#pl030">Pls. XXX</a>,
<a href="#pl031">XXXI</a>, and <a href="#pl032">XXXII</a>. <a href=
"#pl029">Pl. XXIX</a> shows a section of Sipaat a&prime;-to with its
fa&prime;-wi and pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan. The fa&prime;-wi is the
a&prime;-to council house; as such it is more frequented by the old men
than by the younger. The fa&prime;-wi also shelters the skulls of human
heads taken by the a&prime;-to. Outside the pueblo, along certain
trails, there are simple structures also called &ldquo;<span class=
"corr" title="Source: fa&prime;wi">fa&prime;-wi</span>,&rdquo; shelters
where parties halt for feasts, etc., while on various ceremonial
journeys.</p>
<p>The fa&prime;-wi and pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan of each a&prime;-to are
near together, and in five they are under the same roof, though there
is no doorway for intercommunication. What was said of the
pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan as a social center is equally true of the
fa&prime;-wi; each is the lounging place of men and boys, and the
dormitory of unmarried males.</p>
<p>In Samoki each of the eight a&prime;-to has only one public
building, and that is known simply as &ldquo;a&prime;-to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is further convinced of an extensive early movement of the
primitive Malayan from its pristine nest by the presence of
institutions similar to the pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan and fa&prime;-wi over a
vast territory of the Asiatic mainland as well as the Asiatic Islands
and Oceania. That these widespread institutions sprang from the same
source will be seen clearly in the quotations appearing in the footnote
below.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2673src" href="#xd21e2673" name=
"xd21e2673src">1</a> The visible exponent of the institutions is a
building forbidden to women, the functions of which are several; it is
a dormitory for men&mdash;generally unmarried men&mdash;a council
house, a guardhouse, a guest house for men, a center for ceremonials of
the group, and a resting place for the trophies of the chase and
war&mdash;a &ldquo;head house.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> is the
dormitory of the girls in an a&prime;-to from the age of about 2 years
until they marry. It is a small stone and mud-walled structure, roofed
with grass, in which a grown person can seldom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2768" href="#xd21e2768" name=
"xd21e2768">54</a>]</span>stand erect. It has but a single
opening&mdash;a door some <span class="measure" title=
"75 centimeters">30 inches</span> high and <span class="measure" title=
"25 centimeters">10 inches</span> wide. Occupying nearly all the floor
space are boards about <span class="measure" title="1.2 meters">4
feet</span> long and from <span class="measure" title=
"20 to 35 centimeters">8 to 14 inches</span> wide; each board is a
girl&rsquo;s bed. They are placed close together, side by side, laid on
a frame about <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">a
foot</span> above the earth. One end, where the head rests, is slightly
higher that the other, while in most <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> a pole for a foot rest runs along the
foot of the beds <span class="measure" title="about 10 centimeters">a
few inches</span> from them. The building as shown in <a href=
"#pl033">Pl. XXXIII</a> is typical of the nineteen found in Bontoc
pueblo&mdash;though it does not show, what is almost invariably true,
that it is built over one or more pigsties. This condition is
illustrated in <a href="#pl029">Pl. XXIX</a>, where a widow&rsquo;s
house is shown literally resting above the stone walls of several
sties. Unlike the fawi and pabafunan, the <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> has no adjoining court, and no shady
surroundings. It is built to house the occupants only at night.</p>
<p>The <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> is not so distinctly
an ato institution as the pabafunan and fawi. Ato Ungkan never had an
<span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>. The demand is not so urgent
as that of some ato, since there are only thirteen families in Ungkan.
The girls occupy <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> of
neighboring ato.</p>
<p>The <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> of Luwakan, of
Lowingan, and of Sipaat (the last situated in Lowingan) are broken down
and unused at present. There are no marriageable girls in any of these
three ato now, and the small girls occupy near-by <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>. These three <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> will be rebuilt when the girls are large
enough to cook food for the men who build. The <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> of Amkawa is in Buyayyeng near the
<span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> of the latter; it is there by
choice of the occupants.</p>
<p>Mageo, with her twenty families, also has two <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>, but both are situated in
Pudpudchog.</p>
<p>The <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> is the only Igorot
building which has received a specific name, all others bear simply the
class name.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2840src" href="#xd21e2840" name=

<p>In Sagada and some nearby pueblos, as Takong and Agawa, the
<span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> is said to be called
&#300;f-gan&prime;.</p>
<p>Mr. S. H. Damant is quoted from the Calcutta Review (vol. 61, p. 93)
as saying that among the N&#259;g&#259;s, frontier tribes of northeast
India&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Only very young children live entirely with their

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2888" href="#xd21e2888" name=

<p>Again Mr. Damant wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

is not much different from any ordinary house.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Whereas, so far as known, the <span lang=

a similar institution among distant people&mdash;among some of the same

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A&prime;-fong is the general name for Bontoc
dwellings, of which there are two kinds. The first is the
fay&prime;-&uuml; (<a href="#pl034">Pls. XXXIV</a> and <a href=
"#pl036">XXXVI</a>), the large, open, board dwelling, some <span class=
"measure" title="3&frac12; by 4&frac12; meters">12 by 15 feet</span>
square, with side walls only <span class="measure" title=
"a meter">3&frac12; feet</span> high, and having a tall, top-heavy
grass roof. It is the home of the prosperous. The other is the
kat-yu&prime;-fong (<a href="#pl037">Pl. XXXVII</a>), the smaller,
closed, frequently mud-walled dwelling of poor families, and commonly
of the widows.</p>
<p>The family dwelling primarily serves two purposes&mdash;it is the
place where the man, his wife, and small child sleep, and where the
entire family takes its food.</p>
<p>The fay&prime;-&uuml; is built at considerable expense. Three or
four men are required for a period of about two months to get out the
pine boards and timbers in the forest. Each piece of timber for any
permanent building is completed at the time it is cut from the tree,
and is left to season in the mountains; sometimes it remains several
years. (See <a href="#pl035">Pl. XXXV</a>.) When all is ready to
construct the dwelling the owner announces his intention. Some 200 men
of the pueblo gather to erect the building, and two or three dozen
women come to prepare and cook the necessary food, for, whereas no wage
is paid the laborers, all are feasted at the cost of much rice and
several hogs and a carabao or two. The toiling and feasting continue
about ten days.</p>
<p>The following description of a fay&prime;-&uuml; is of an ordinary
dwelling in Bontoc pueblo: The fay&prime;-&uuml; are all constructed on
the same plan, though a few are larger than the one here described, and
some few are smaller. The front and back walls of the house are
<span class="measure" title="105 centimeters">3 feet 6 inches</span>
high and <span class="measure" title="3.8 meters">12 feet 6
inches</span> long. The two side walls are the same height as the ends,
but are <span class="measure" title="4&frac34; meters">15 feet 6
inches</span> long. The rear wall is built of stones carefully chinked
with mud. The side walls consist each of two boards extending the full
length of the structure. The front wall is cut near the middle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2949" href="#xd21e2949" name=
"xd21e2949">56</a>]</span>from top to bottom with a doorway
<span class="measure" title="40 centimeters">1 foot 4 inches</span>
wide; otherwise the front wall is like the two side walls, except that
it has a roughly triangular timber grooved along the lower side and
fitted over the top board as a cap. The doorposts are two timbers sunk
in the ground; their tops fit into the two &ldquo;caps,&rdquo; and each
has a groove from top to bottom into which the ends of the boards of
the front wall are inserted. A few dwellings have a door consisting of
a single board set on end and swinging on a projection sunk in a hole
in a doorsill buried in the earth; the upper part of the door swings on
a string secured to the doorpost and passing through a hole in the
door.</p>
<p>At each of the four corners of the building, immediately inside the
walls, is a post set in the ground and standing <span class="measure"
title="205 centimeters">6 feet 9 inches</span> high. The boards of the
walls are tied to these corner posts, and the greater part of the
weight of the roof rests on their tops. Four other posts, also planted
in the ground and about as high as the corner posts, stand about
<span class="measure" title="120 centimeters">4 feet</span> inside the
walls of the house equidistant from the corner post and marking the
corners of a rectangle about <span class="measure" title=
"170 centimeters square">5&frac12; feet square</span>. They directly
support the second story of the building.</p>
<p>There is no floor except the earth in the first story of the Bontoc
dwelling, and from the door at the front of the building to the two
rear posts of the four central ones there is an unobstructed passage or
aisle called &ldquo;cha-la&prime;-nan.&rdquo; At one&rsquo;s left, as
he enters the door, is a small room called &ldquo;chap-an&prime;&rdquo;
<span class="measure" title="170 centimeters square">5&frac12; feet
square</span> separated from the aisle by a row of low stones partially
sunk in the earth. The earth in this room is excavated so that the
floor is about <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">1
foot</span> lower than that of the remainder of the building, and in
its center the peculiar double wooden rice mortar is imbedded in the
earth. It is in the chap-an&prime; that the family rice and millet is
threshed. At the left of the aisle and immediately beyond the
chap-an&prime;, separated from it by a board partition the same height
as the outside walls of the house, is the cooking room, called
&ldquo;cha-le-ka-nan&prime; si mo-o&prime;-to.&rdquo; It is
approximately the same size as the threshing room. There are neither
boards nor stones to cut this cooking room off from the open aisle of
the house, but its width is determined by a low pile of stones built
along its farther side from the outer house wall toward the aisle and
ending at the rear left post of the four central ones. In the face of
this stone wall are three concavities&mdash;fireplaces over which
cooking pots are placed. Arranged along the outer wall, and about
<span class="measure" title="60 centimeters">2 feet</span> high, is a
board shelf on which the water jars are kept.</p>
<p>At the right of the aisle, as one enters the building, is a broad
shelf about <span class="measure" title="3&frac12; meters">12
feet</span> long; in width it extends from the side wall to the two
right central posts. On this shelf, called
&ldquo;ch&ucirc;k&prime;-so,&rdquo; are placed the various baskets and
other utensils and implements of everyday use. Beneath it are stored
the small cages or coops in which the chickens <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2981" href="#xd21e2981" name=
"xd21e2981">57</a>]</span>sleep at night. There are a few
fay&prime;-&uuml; in Bontoc in which the threshing room and cooking
room are on the right of the aisle and the long bench is on the left,
but they are very rare exceptions.</p>
<p>In the rear of the building is a board partition apparently
extending from one side wall to the other. The bench at the right of
the aisle ends against this partition, and on the left the stone
fireplaces are built against it. This rear section is covered over with
boards at the height of the outside wall, so that a low box is formed,
<span class="measure" title="1 meter">3&frac12; feet</span> high and
<span class="measure" title="1.30 meter">4&frac14; feet</span> wide. At
the rear of the aisle a door <span class="measure" title=
"90 centimeters">3 feet</span> high and <span class="measure" title=
"40 centimeters">1 foot 4 inches</span> wide swings into this rear
apartment, which, when the door is again closed, is as black as night.
An examination of the inside of this section shows it to be entirely
walled with stones except where the narrow door cuts it. By inside
measure it is only <span class="measure" title="105 centimeters">3 feet
6 inches</span> wide and <span class="measure" title="2 meters">6 feet
6 inches</span> long. This is the sleeping apartment, and is called
ang-an&prime;. As one crawls into this kennel he is likely to place his
hands among ashes and charred sticks which mark the place for a fire on
cold nights. The left end of the ang-an&prime; contains two boards or
beds for the man and his wife. Each board is about <span class=
"measure" title="45 centimeters">18 inches</span> wide and <span class=
"measure" title="120 centimeters">4 feet</span> long; they are raised
<span class="measure" title="50 or 75 millimeters">2 or 3 inches</span>
from the earth, and the head of the bed is slightly higher than the
foot. A pole is laid across the apartment at the lower end of the
sleeping boards, and on this the occupants rest their feet and toast
them before the small fire. At both ends of the ang-an&prime;, outside
the store walls, is a small hidden secret space called
&ldquo;k&ucirc;b-k&ucirc;b,&rdquo; in which the family hides many of
its choice possessions. During abundant camote<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3013src" href="#xd21e3013" name="xd21e3013src">5</a> gathering,
however, I have seen the k&ucirc;b-k&ucirc;b filled with camotes. I
should probably not have discovered these spaces had there not been so
great a discrepancy between the inside measure of the sleeping room and
width of the building.</p>
<p>I know of no other primitive dwellings in the Philippines than the
ones in the Bontoc culture area which are built directly on the ground.
Most of them are raised on posts <span class="measure" title=
"a meter or more">several feet</span> from the earth. Some few have
side walls extending to the ground, but even those have a floor raised
<span class="measure" title="60 centimeters or more">2, 3, or more
feet</span> from the ground and which is reached by means of a short
ladder.</p>
<p>The second story of the Bontoc dwelling is supported on the four
central posts. On all sides it projects beyond them, so that it is
about <span class="measure" title="2 meters square">7 feet
square</span>; it is about <span class="measure" title=
"1&frac12; meter">5 feet</span> high. A door enters the second story
directly from the aisle, and is reached by an <span class="measure"
title="2&frac12;-meter">8-foot</span> ladder. This second story is
constructed, floor and side walls, of boards. The side walls cease at
about the height of <span class="measure" title="60 centimeters">2
feet</span> where a horizontal shelf is built on them extending outside
of them to the roof. It is about <span class="measure" title=
"60 centimeters">2 feet</span> wide and is usually stored with
unthreshed rice and millet or with jars of preserved meats. Just at the
left on the floor, as one enters the second story, is an earth-filled
square corner walled in by two poles. On this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3045" href="#xd21e3045" name=
"xd21e3045">58</a>]</span>earth are three stones&mdash;the fireplace,
where each year a chicken is cooked in a household ceremony at the
close of rice harvests.</p>
<p>Rising above the second story is a third. In the smaller dwellings
this third story is only an attic of the second, but in the larger
buildings it is an independent story. To be sure, it is entered through
the floor, but a ladder is used, and its floor is of strong heavy
boards. It is at all times a storeroom, usually only for cereals. In
the smaller houses it amounts simply to a broad shelf about the height
of one&rsquo;s waist as he stands on the floor of the second story and
his head and upper body rise through the hole in the floor. In the
larger houses a person may climb into the third story and work there
with practically as much freedom as in the second.</p>
<p>The <span class="measure" title="150-centimeter">5-foot</span>
ridgepole of the steep, heavy, grass roof is supported by two posts
rising from the basal timbers of the third story. The roof falls away
sharply from the ridgepole not only at the sides but at the ends, so
that, except at the ridge, the roof appears square. Immediately beneath
both ends of the ridgepole there is a small opening in the grass
through which the smoke of the cooking fires is supposed to escape.
However, I have scarcely ever seen smoke issue from them, and, since
the entire inner part of the building from the floor of the second
story to the ridgepole is thickly covered with soot, it seems that
little unconsumed carbon escapes through the smoke holes. The lower
part of the roof, for <span class="measure" title=
"105 centimeters">3&frac12; feet</span>, descends at a less steep
angle, thus forming practically an awning against sun and rain. Its
lower edge is about <span class="measure" title="120 centimeters">4
feet</span> from the ground and projects some <span class="measure"
title="120 centimeters">4 feet</span> beyond the side walls of the
lower story.</p>
<p>The kat-yu&prime;-fong, the dwelling of the poor, consists of a
one-story structure built on the ground with the earth for the floor.
Some such buildings have a partition or partial partition running
across them, beyond which are the sleeping boards, and there are
shelves here and there; but the kat-yu&prime;-fong is a makeshift, and
consequently is not so fixed a type of dwelling as the
fay&prime;-&uuml;.</p>
<p>Piled close around the dwellings is a supply of firewood in the
shape of pine blocks <span class="measure" title=
"90 to 120 centimeters">3 or 4 feet</span> long, usually cut from large
trees. These blocks furnish favorite lounging places for the women. The
people live most of the time outside their dwellings, and it is there
that the social life of the married women is. Any time of day they may
be seen close to the a&prime;-fong in the shade of the low, projecting
roof sitting spinning or paring camotes; often three or four neighbors
sit thus together and gossip. The men are seldom with them, being about
the ato buildings in the daytime when not working. A few small children
may be about the dwelling, as the little girls frequently help in
preparing food for cooking.</p>
<p>During the day the dwelling is much alone. When it is so left one
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3073" href="#xd21e3073" name=
"xd21e3073">59</a>]</span>sometimes two runo stalks are set up in the
earth on each side of the door leaning against the roof and projecting
some <span class="measure" title="2&frac12; meters">8 feet</span> in
the air. This is the pud-i-pud&prime;, the &ldquo;ethics lock&rdquo; on
an Igorot dwelling. An Igorot who enters the a&prime;-fong of a
neighbor when the pud-i-pud&prime; is up is called a thief&mdash;in the
mind of all who see him he is such.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bontoc families are monogamous, and monogamy is the
rule throughout the area, though now and then a man has two wives. The
presidente of Titipan has five wives, for each of whom he has a
separate house, and during my residence in Bontoc he was building a
sixth house for a new wife; but such a family is the exception&mdash;I
never heard of another.</p>
<p>Many marriage unions produce eight and ten children, though, since
the death rate is large, it is probable that families do not average
more than six individuals.</p>

<h4 class="main">Childbirth</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A woman is usually about her daily labors in the
house, the mountains, or the irrigated fields almost to the hour of
childbirth. The child is born without feasting or ceremony, and only
two or three friends witness the birth. The father of the child is
there, if he is the woman&rsquo;s husband; the girl&rsquo;s mother is
also with her, but usually there are no others, unless it be an old
woman.</p>
<p>The expectant woman stands with her body bent strongly forward at
the waist and supported by the hands grasping some convenient house
timber about the height of the hips; or she may take a more animal-like
position, placing both hands and feet on the earth.</p>
<p>The labor, lasting three or four hours, is unassisted by medicines
or baths; but those in attendance&mdash;the man as well as the
woman&mdash;hasten the birth by a gently downward drawing of the hands
about the woman&rsquo;s abdomen.</p>
<p>During a period of ten days after childbirth the mother frequently
bathes herself about the hips and abdomen with hot water, but has no
change of diet. For two or three days she keeps the house closely,
reclining much of the time.</p>
<p>The Igorot woman is a constant laborer from the age of puberty or
before, until extreme incapacity of old age stays the hands of toil;
but for two or three months following the advent of each babe the
mother does not work in the fields. She busies herself about the house
and with the new-found duties of a mother, while the husband performs
her labors in the fields.</p>
<p>The Igorot loves all his children, and says, when a boy is born,
&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and if a girl is born he says it is equally
&ldquo;good&rdquo;&mdash;it is the fact of a child in the family that
makes him happy. People in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3100"
href="#xd21e3100" name="xd21e3100">60</a>]</span>Igorot stage of
culture have little occasion to prize one sex over the other. The
Igorot neither, even in marriage. One is practically as capable as the
other at earning a living, and both are needed in the group.</p>
<p>Six or seven days after birth a chicken is killed and eaten by the
family in honor of the child, but there is no other
ceremony&mdash;there is not even a special name for the feast.</p>
<p>If a woman gives birth to a stillborn child it is at once washed,
wrapped in a bit of cloth, and buried in a camote sementera close to
the dwelling.</p>

<p class="first">The Igorot do not understand
twins,&mdash;na-a-p&#301;k&prime;, as <span class="corr" title=
"Source: the">they</span> say. Carabaos have only one babe at a birth,
so why should women have two babes? they ask. They believe that one of
the twins, which unfortunate one they call
&ldquo;a-t&#301;n-fu-yang&prime;,&rdquo; is an anito child; it is the
offspring of an anito.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3114src" href=
"#xd21e3114" name="xd21e3114src">6</a> The anito father is said to have
been with the mother of the twins in her unconscious slumber, and she
is in no way criticised or reproached.</p>
<p>The most quiet babe, or, if they are equally quiet, the larger one,
is said to be &ldquo;a-t&#301;n-fu-yang&prime;,&rdquo; and is at once
placed in an olla<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3125src" href="#xd21e3125"

<p>On the 13th of April, 1903, the wife of A-li-koy&prime;, of Samoki,
gave birth to twin babies. Contrary to the advice and solicitations of
the old men and the universal custom of the people, A-li-koy&prime;
saved both children, because, as he pointed out, an Ilokano of Bontoc
had twin children, now 7 years old, and they are all right. Thus the
breaking down of this peculiar form of infanticide may have begun.</p>

<h4 class="main">Abortion</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Both married and unmarried women practice abortion
when for any reason the prospective child is not desired. It is usual,
however, for the mother of a pregnant girl to object to her aborting,
saying that soon she would become &ldquo;po&prime;-ta&rdquo;&mdash;the
common mate of several men, rather than the faithful wife of one.</p>
<p>Abortion is accomplished without the use of drugs and is successful
only during the first eight or ten weeks of pregnancy. The abdomen is
bathed for several days in hot water, and the body is pressed and
stroked downward with the hands. The foetus is buried by the woman.
Only the woman herself or her mother or other near female friend is
present at the abortion, though no effort is made at secrecy and its
practice is no disgrace.</p>

<h5 class="main">Care of child in parents&rsquo; dwelling</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All male babes are called
&ldquo;kil-lang&prime;&rdquo; and all girl babes
&ldquo;gna-an&prime;.&rdquo; All live practically the same life day
after day. Their sole nourishment is their mother&rsquo;s milk, varied
now and then by that of some other woman, if the mother is obliged to
leave the babe for a half day or so. When the babe&rsquo;s first teeth
appear it has a slight change of diet; its attendant now and then feeds
it cooked rice, thoroughly masticated and mixed with saliva. This food
is passed to the child&rsquo;s mouth directly from that of the
attendant by contact of lips&mdash;quite as the domestic canary feeds
its young. The babes are always unclothed, and for several months are
washed daily in cold water, usually both morning and night. It is a
common sight at the river to see the mother, who has come down with her
babe on her back for an olla of water, bathe the babe, who never seems
at all frightened in the process, but to enjoy it&mdash;this, too, at
times when the water would seem to be uncomfortably cold. One often
sees the father or grandmother washing the older babes at the
river.</p>
<p>But in spite of these baths the Igorot babe, at least after it has
reached the age of six or eight months, when seen in the pueblo is
almost without exception very dirty; a child of a year or a year and a
half is usually repulsively so. Its head has received no attention
since birth, and is scaly and dirty if not actually full of sores. Its
baths are now relatively infrequent, and its need of them as it plays
on the dirt floor of the dwelling or pabafunan even more urgent than
when it spent most of its time in the carrying blanket.</p>
<p>Babes have no cradles or stationary places for rest or sleep. A
babe, slumbering or awake, is never laid down alone because of the fear
that an anito will injure it. At night the babe sleeps between its
parents, on its mother&rsquo;s arm. It spends its days almost without
exception sitting in a blanket which is tied over the shoulder of one
of its parents, its brother, or its sister. There it hangs, awake or
asleep, sitting or sprawling, often a pitiable little object with the
sun in its eyes and the flies hovering over its dirty face. Frequently
a child of only 5 or 6 years old may be seen with a babe on its back,
and older children are constant baby tenders. Babes may be found in the
fawi and pabafunan where the men are lounging (<a href="#pl032">Pl.
XXXII</a>), and the old men and women also care for their
grandchildren. Grown people quite as commonly carry the babe astride
one hip if they have an empty hand which they can put around it, and
often a mother along the trail carries it at her breast where it
seemingly nurses as contentedly as when in the shade of the
dwelling.</p>
<p>Children are generally weaned long before they are 2 years old, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3155" href="#xd21e3155" name=
"xd21e3155">62</a>]</span>twice I have seen a young pillager of 5
years, while patting and stroking his mother&rsquo;s hips and body as
she transplanted rice, yield to his early baby instinct and suckle from
her pendant breasts.</p>
<p>After the child is about 2 years of age it is not customary for it
to sleep longer at the home of the parents; the girl goes nightly to
the olag, and the boy to the pabafunan or the fawi. However, this is
not a hard-and-fast rule, and the age at which the child goes to the
olag or fawi depends much on circumstances. The length of time it
sleeps with the parents doubtless depends upon the advent or nonadvent
of another child. If a little girl has a widowed grandmother or aunt
she may sleep for a few years with her. During the warmer months one or
two children may sleep on the stationary broad bench, the chukso, in
the open part of the parents&rsquo; house. It is safe to say that after
the ages of 6 or 7 all children are found nightly in the olag,
pabafunan, or fawi. I have seen a group of little girls from 4 to 10
years old, immediately after supper and while some families were still
eating, sitting around a small blaze of fire just outside the door of
their olag. The Igorot child as a rule knows its parents&rsquo; home
only as a place to eat. There is almost an entire absence of anything
which may be called home life.</p>

</div>
<div class="div4 subsubsection" id="xd21e3159">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main">Naming</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot has no definite system of naming. Parents
may frequently change the name of a child, and an individual may change
his during maturity. There are several reasons why names are changed,
but there is no system, nor is it ever necessary to change them.</p>
<p>A child usually receives its first personal name between the years
of 2 and 5. This first name is always that of some dead ancestor,
usually only two or three generations past. The reason for this is the
belief that the anito of the ancestor cares for and protects its
descendants when they are abroad. If the name a child bears is that of
a dead ancestor it will receive the protection of the anito of the
ancestor; if the child does not prosper or has accidents or ill health,
the parents will seek a more careful or more benevolent protector in
the anito of some other ancestor whose name is given the child.</p>
<p>To illustrate this changing of names: A boy in Tukukan, two hours
from Bontoc, was first named Sa-pang&prime; when less than a year old.
At the end of a year the paternal grandfather, An-ti&prime;-ko, died in
Tukukan, and the babe was named An-ti&prime;-ko. In a few years the
boy&rsquo;s father died, and the mother married a man in Bontoc, the
home of her childhood. She moved to Bontoc with her boy, and then
changed his name to Fa-li-kao&prime;, her dead father&rsquo;s name. The
reason for this last change was because the anito of An-ti&prime;-ko,
always in or about Tukukan, could not care for the child in Bontoc,
whereas the anito of Fa-li-kao&prime; in Bontoc could do so.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3168" href="#xd21e3168" name=
"xd21e3168">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>The selection of the names of ancestors is shown by the following
generations:</p>
<ul lang="bo">
<li>1. Mang-i-lot&prime;</li>
<li>2. Cho-kas&prime;</li>
<li>3. Kom-l&#301;ng&prime;</li>
<li>4. Mang-i-lot&prime;</li>
<li>5 <i>a.</i> Kom-l&#301;ng&prime;</li>
<li>5 <i>b.</i> Ta-kay&prime;-y&#277;ng</li>
<li>5 <i>c.</i> T&#277;ng-ab&prime;</li>
<li>5 <i>d.</i> Ka-w&#277;ng&prime;</li>
</ul>
<p>Mang-i-lot&prime; (4) is the baby name of an old man now about 60
years old; it was the name of his great-grandfather (1). Numbers 5
<i>a</i>, 5 <i>b</i>, 5 <i>c</i>, and 5 <i>d</i> are the sons of
Mang-i-lot&prime; (4), all of whom died before receiving a second name.
The child Kom-l&#301;ng&prime; (5 a) was given the name of his paternal
grandfather (3). Ta-kay&prime;-y&#277;ng (5 <i>b</i>) bears the name of
his maternal great-grandfather. T&#277;ng-ab&prime; (5 <i>c</i>) and
Ka-w&#277;ng&prime; (5 <i>d</i>) both bear the names of uncles,
brothers of the boy&rsquo;s mother. The present name of
Mang-i-lot&prime; (4) is O-lu-wan&prime;; this is the name of a man at
Barlig whose head was the first one taken by Mang-i-lot&prime;. A man
may change his name each time he takes a head, though it is not
customary to do so more than once or twice.</p>
<p>Girls as well as boys may receive during childhood two or three
names, that they may receive the protection of an anito. In Igorot
names there is no vestige of a kinship group tracing relation through
either the paternal or maternal line.</p>
<p>The people are generally reticent about telling their names; and
when they do tell, the name given is usually the one borne in
childhood; an old man will generally answer
&ldquo;am-a&prime;-ma,&rdquo; meaning simply &ldquo;old man.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 class="main">Circumcision</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most boys are circumcised at from 4 to 7 years of age.
The act of circumcision, called &ldquo;s&#301;g-i-at&prime;,&rdquo;
occurs privately without feasting or rite. The only formality is the
payment of a few leaves of tobacco to the man who performs the
operation. There are one or two old men in each ato who understand
circumcision, but there is no cult for its performance or
perpetuation.</p>
<p>The foreskin is cut lengthwise on the upper side for <span class=
"measure" title="about one centimeter">half an inch</span>. Either a
sharp, blade-like piece of bamboo is inserted in the foreskin which is
cut from the inside, or the back point of a battle-ax is stuck firmly
in the earth, and the foreskin is cut by being drawn over the sharp
point of the blade.</p>
<p>The Igorot say that if the foreskin is not cut it will grow long, as
does the unclipped camote vine. What the origin or purpose of
circumcision was is not now known by the people of Bontoc. The practice
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3241" href="#xd21e3241" name=

<h5 class="main">Amusements</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The life of little girls is strangely devoid of games
and playthings. They have no dolls and, I have never seen them play
with the puppies which are scattered throughout the pueblo much of the
year&mdash;both common playthings for the girls of primitive people. It
is not improbable that the instinct which compels most girls, no matter
what their grade of culture, to play the mother is given full
expression in the necessary care of babes&mdash;a care in which the
girls, often themselves almost babes, have a much larger part than
their brothers. Girls also go to the fields with their parents much
more than do the boys.</p>
<p>Girls and boys never play together in the same group. Time and again
one comes suddenly on a romping group of chattering, naked little boys
or girls. They usually run noiselessly into the nearest foliage or
behind the nearest building, and there stand unmoving, as a pursued
chicken pokes its head into the grass and seems to think itself hidden.
They need not be afraid of one, seeing him every day, yet the instinct
to flee is strong in them&mdash;they do exactly what their mothers do
when suddenly met in the trail&mdash;they run away, or start to.</p>
<p>Several times I have found little girls building tiny sementeras
with pebbles, and it is probable they play at planting and harvesting
the crops common to their pueblo. They have one game called &ldquo;I
catch your ankle,&rdquo; which is the best expression of unfettered
childplay and mirth I have ever seen.</p>
<p>After the sun had dropped behind the mountain close to the pueblo,
from six to a dozen girls ranging from 5 to 10 or 11 years of age came
almost nightly to the smooth grass plat in front of our house to play
&ldquo;s&#301;s-s&#301;s&prime;-ki&rdquo; (I catch your ankle). They
laid aside their blankets and lined up nude in two opposing lines
<span class="measure" title="3&frac12; or 5&frac12; meters">twelve or
fifteen feet</span> apart. All then called:
&ldquo;S&#301;s-s&#301;s&prime;-ki ad wa&prime;-ni wa&prime;-ni!&rdquo;
(which is, &ldquo;I catch your ankle, now! now!&rdquo;). Immediately
the two lines crouched on their haunches, and, in half-sitting posture,
with feet side by side, each girl bounced toward her opponent
endeavoring to catch her ankle. After the two attacking parties met
they intermingled, running and tumbling, chasing and chased, and the
successful girl rapidly dragged her victim by the ankle along the grass
until caught and thrown by a relief party or driven away by the
approach of superior numbers. They lined up anew every five or ten
minutes.</p>
<p>During the entire game, lasting a full half hour or until night
settled on them or a mother came to take home one of the little,
romping, wild things&mdash;just as the American child is called from
her games to an early bed&mdash;peal after peal of the heartiest,
sweetest laughter rang a constant chorus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3262" href="#xd21e3262" name="xd21e3262">65</a>]</span>The boys
have at least two systematic games. One is
f&ucirc;g-f&ucirc;g-to&prime;, in imitation of a ceremonial of the men
after each annual rice harvest. The game is a combat with rocks, and is
played sometimes by thirty or forty boys, sometimes by a much smaller
number. The game is a contest&mdash;usually between Bontoc and
Samoki&mdash;with the broad, gravelly river bed as the battle ground.
There they charge and retreat as one side gains or loses ground; the
rocks fly fast and straight, and are sometimes warded off by small
basket-work shields shaped like the wooden ones of war. They sometimes
play for an hour and a half at a time, and I have not yet seen them
play when one side was not routed and driven home on the run amid the
shouts of the victors.</p>
<p>The other game is kag-kag-tin&prime;. It is also a game of combat
and of opposing sides, but it is not so dangerous as the other and
there are no bruises resulting. Some half-dozen or a dozen boys play
kag-kag-tin&prime; charging and retreating, fighting with the bare
feet. The naked foot necessitates a different kick than the one shod
with a rigid leather shoe; the stroke from an unshod foot is more like
a blow from the fist shot out from the shoulder. The foot lands flat
and at the side of or behind the kicker, and the blow is aimed at the
trunk or head&mdash;it usually lands higher than the hips. This game in
a combat between individuals of the opposing sides, though two often
attack a single opponent until he is rescued by a companion. The game
is over when the retreating side no longer advances to the combat.</p>
<p>The boys are constantly throwing reed spears, and they are fairly
expert spearmen several years before they have a steel-bladed spear of
their own. Frequently they roll the spherical grape fruit and throw
their reeds at the fruit as it passes.</p>
<p>Here, there, and everywhere, singly or in groups, boys perform the
Igorot dance step. A tin can in a boy&rsquo;s hands is irresistibly
beaten in rhythmic time, and the dance as surely follows the peculiar
rhythmic beating as the beating follows the possession of the can. As
the boys come stringing home at night from watching the palay fields,
they come dancing, rhythmically beating a can, or two sticks, or their
dinner basket, or beating time in the air&mdash;as though they held a
gangsa<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3270src" href="#xd21e3270" name=
"xd21e3270src">8</a>. The dance is in them, and they amuse themselves
with it constantly.</p>
<p>Both boys and girls are much in the river, where they swim and dive
with great frolic.</p>
<p>During the months of January and February, 1903, when there was much
wind, the boys were daily flying kites, but it is a pastime borrowed of
the Ilokano in the pueblo. Now and then a little fellow may be seen
with a small, very rude bow and arrow, which also is borrowed from the
Ilokano since the arrival of the Spaniard. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>
is primarily the sleeping place of all unmarried girls, in the mind of
the people it is, with startling consistency, the mating place of the
young people of marriageable age.</p>
<p>A common sight on a rest day in the pueblo is that of a young man
and woman, each with an arm around the other, loitering about under the
same blanket, talking and laughing, one often almost supporting the
other. There seems at all times to be the greatest freedom and
friendliness among the young people. I have seen both a young man
carrying a young woman lying horizontally along his shoulders, and a
young woman carrying a young man astride her back. However, practically
all courtship is carried on in the <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>.</p>
<p>The courtship of the Igorot is closely defined when it is said that
marriage never takes place prior to sexual intimacy, and rarely prior
to pregnancy. There is one exception. This is when a rich and
influential man marries a girl against her desires, but through the
urgings of her parents.</p>
<p>It is customary for a young man to be sexually intimate with one,
two, three, and even more girls at the same time. Two or more of them
may be residents of one <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>, and
it is common for two or three men to visit the same <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> at one time.</p>
<p>A girl is almost invariably faithful to her temporary lover, and
this fact is the more surprising in the face of the young man&rsquo;s
freedom and the fact that the <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>
is nightly filled with little girls whose moral training is had
there.</p>
<p>Young men are boldly and pointedly invited to the <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>. A common form of invitation is for the
girl to steal a man&rsquo;s pipe, his pocket hat, or even the
breechcloth he is wearing. They say one seldom recovers his property
without going to the, <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> for
it.</p>
<p>When a girl recognizes her pregnancy she at once joyfully tells her
condition to the father of the child, as all women desire children and
there are few permanent marriages unblessed by them. The young man, if
he does not wish to marry the girl, may keep her in ignorance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3323" href="#xd21e3323" name=
"xd21e3323">67</a>]</span>of his intentions for two or three months. If
at last he tells her he will not marry her she receives the news with
many tears, it is said, but is spared the gossip and reproach of
others, and she will later become the wife of some other man, since her
first child has proved her power to bear children.</p>
<p>When the mother notices her condition she asks who the father of the
child is, and on being told that the man will not marry her the mother
often tries to exert a rather tardy influence for better morals. She
says, &ldquo;That is bad. Why have you done this?&rdquo; (when the
chances are that the unfortunate, girl was born into a family of but
one head); &ldquo;it will be well for him to give the child a sementera
to work.&rdquo; About the same time the young man informs his mother of
his relations with the girl, and of her condition, and again the maker
of a people&rsquo;s morals seems to attempt to mold the already
hardened clay. She says, &ldquo;My son, that is bad. Why have you done
it? Why do you not marry her?&rdquo; And the son answers simply and
truthfully, &ldquo;I have another girl.&rdquo; Without attempt at
remonstrance the father gives a rice sementera to the child when it is
6 or 7 years old, for that is the price fixed by the group conscience
for deserting a girl with a child.</p>
<p>It is not usual for a married man to go to the <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>, though a young man may go if one of his
late mates is still alone. He is usually welcomed by the girl, for
there may yet be possibilities of her becoming his permanent wife. A
man whose wife is pregnant, however, seldom visits the <span lang=
"bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>, because he fears that, if he does, his
wife&rsquo;s child will be prematurely born and die.</p>
<p>The <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> is built where the
girls desire it and is said to be commonly located in places accessible
to the men; this appears true to one going over the pueblo with this
statement in mind.</p>
<p>The life in the <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> does not
seem to weaken the boys or girls or cause them to degenerate, neither
does it appear to make them vicious. Whereas there is practically no
sense of modesty among the people, I have never seen anything lewd.
Though there is no such thing as virtue, in the modern sense of the
word, among the young people after puberty, children before puberty are
said to be virtuous, and the married woman is said always to be true to
her husband.</p>

<p>There is no such institution in Bontoc Igorot society. The purpose
of the <span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span> is as far from
enforcing chastity as it well can be. The old women never frequent the
<span lang="bo">o&prime;-l&acirc;g</span>, and the lesson the girls
learn there is the necessity for maternity, not the &ldquo;industries
of their sex&rdquo;&mdash;which children of very primitive people
acquire quite as a young fowl learns to scratch and get its food.</p>

<h4 class="main">Marriage</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ethics of the group forbid certain unions in
marriage. A man may not marry his mother, his stepmother, or a sister
of either. He may not marry his daughter, stepdaughter, or adopted
daughter. He may not marry his sister, or his brother&rsquo;s widow, or
a first cousin by blood or adoption. Sexual intercourse between persons
in the above relations is considered incest, and does not often occur.
The line of kin does not appear to be traced as far as second cousin,
and between such there are no restrictions.</p>
<p>Rich people often pledge their small children in marriage, though,
as elsewhere in the world, love, instead of the plans of parents, is
generally the foundation of the family. In February, 1903, the rich
people of Bontoc were quite stirred up over the sequel to a marriage
plan projected some fifteen years before. Two families then pledged
their children. The boy grew to be a man of large stature, while the
girl was much smaller. The man wished to marry another young woman, who
fought the first girl when visited by her to talk over the matter. Then
the blind mother of the pledged girl went to the dwelling, accompanied
by her brother, one of the richest men in the pueblo, whereupon the
father and mother of the successful girl knocked them down and beat
them. To all appearances the young lovers will marry in spite of the
early pledges of parents. They say such quarrels are common.</p>
<p>If a man wishes to marry a woman and she shares his desire, or if on
her becoming pregnant he desires to marry her, he speaks with her
parents and with his. If either of her parents objects, no marriage
occurs; but he does not usually falter, even though his parents do
object. They say the advent of a babe seldom fails to win the good will
of the young man&rsquo;s parents. In the case of the girl&rsquo;s
pregnancy, marriage is more assured, and her father builds or gives her
a house. The olag is no longer for her. In her case it has served its
ultimate purpose&mdash;it has announced her puberty and proved her
powers of womanhood. In the case of a desire of marriage before the
girl is pregnant she usually sleeps in the olag, as in the past, and
the young man spends most of his nights with her. It is customary for
the couple to take their meals with the parents of the girl, in which
case the young man gives his labors to the family. The period of his
labors is usually less than a year, since it is customary for him to
give his affections <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3376" href=
"#xd21e3376" name="xd21e3376">69</a>]</span>to another girl within a
year if the first one does not become pregnant.</p>
<p>In other words their union is a true trial union. If the trial is
successful the girl&rsquo;s father builds her a dwelling, and the
marriage ceremony occurs immediately upon occupation of the dwelling.
The ceremony is in two parts. The first is called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">in-pa-ke&prime;</span>,&rdquo; and at that time a hog or carabao
is killed, and the two young people start housekeeping. The <span lang=
"bo">kap&prime;-i-ya</span> ceremony follows&mdash;among the rich this
marriage ceremony occupies two days, but with the poor only one day.
The <span lang="bo">kap&prime;-i-ya</span> is performed by an old man
of the ato in which the couple is to live. He suggestively places a
hen&rsquo;s egg, some rice, and some tapui<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3389src" href="#xd21e3389" name="xd21e3389src">10</a> in a dish
before him while he addresses Lumawig, the one god, as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Thou, Lumawig! now these children desire to unite in
marriage. They wish to be blessed with many children. When they possess
pigs, may they grow large. When they cultivate their palay, may it have
large fruitheads. May their chickens also grow large. When they plant
their beans may they spread over the ground, May they dwell quietly
together in harmony. May the man&rsquo;s vitality quicken the seed of
the woman.</p>
</div>
<p>The two-day marriage ceremony of the rich is very festive. The
parents kill a wild carabao, as well as chickens and pigs, and the
entire pueblo comes to feast and dance. It is customary for the pueblo
to have a rest day, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">fo-sog&prime;</span>,&rdquo; following the marriage of the rich,
so the entire period given to the marriage is three days. Each party to
the, marriage receives some property at the time from the parents.
There are no women in Bontoc pueblo who have not entered into the trial
union, though all have not succeeded in reaching the ceremony of
permanent marriage. However, notwithstanding all their standards and
trials, there are several happy permanent marriages which have never
been blessed with children. There are only two men in Bontoc who have
never been married and who never entered the trial stage, and both are
deaf and dumb.</p>

<h5 class="main">Divorce</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The people of Bontoc say they never knew a man and
woman to separate if a child was born to the pair and it lived and they
had recognized themselves married. But, as the marriage is generally
prompted because a child is to be born, so an unfruitful union is
generally broken in the hope that another will be more successful.</p>
<p>If either party desires to break the contract the other seldom
objects. If they agree to separate, the woman usually remains in their
dwelling and the man builds himself another. However, if either person
objects, it is the other who relinquishes the dwelling&mdash;the man
because he can build another and the woman because she seldom seeks
separation unless she knows of a home in which she will be welcome.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3408" href="#xd21e3408" name=

<p>Nothing in the nature of alimony, except the dwelling, is commonly
given by either party to a divorce. There are two exceptions&mdash;in
case a party deserts he forfeits to the other one or more rice
sementeras or other property of considerable value; and, again, if the
woman bore her husband a child which died he must give her a sementera
if he leaves her.</p>

<h5 class="main">The widowed</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If either party to a marriage dies the other does not
remarry for one year. There is no penalty enforced by the group for an
earlier marriage, but the custom is firmly fixed. Should the surviving
person marry within a year he would die, being killed by an anito whose
business it is to punish such sacrilege. The widowed frequently
remarry, as there are certain advantages in their married life. It is
quite impossible for a man or woman alone to perform the entire round
of Igorot labors. The hours of labor for the lone person must usually
be long and tiresome.</p>
<p>Most of the widowed live in the katyufong, the smaller dwelling of
the poor. The reason for this is that even if one has owned the better
class of dwelling, the fayu, it is generally given to a child at
marriage, the smaller house being sufficient and suitable for the lone
person, especially as the widowed very frequently take their meals with
some married child.</p>

<p class="first">Orphans without homes of their own become members of
the household of an uncle or aunt or other near relative. The property
they received from their parents is used by the family into whose home
they go. Upon marriage the children receive the property as it was left
them, the annual increase having gone to the family which cared for
them.</p>
<p>If there are no relatives, orphans with property readily find a
home; if there are neither relatives nor property, some family receives
the children more as servants than as equals. When they are married
they are usually not given more than a dwelling.</p>

infirmity is the beginning of the end with all except the blind.</p>
<p>The chances are that the old who have no relatives have at least a
little property. Such persons are readily cared for by some family

<h3 class="main">Sickness, disease, and remedies</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All disease, sickness, or ailment, however serious or
slight, among the Bontoc Igorot is caused by an <span lang=
"bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span>. If smallpox kills half a dozen persons in
one day, the fell work is that of an <span lang=
"bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span>; if a man receives a stone bruise on the
trail an <span lang="bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span> is in the foot and must
be removed before recovery is possible. There is one exception to the
above sweeping charge against the <span lang=
"bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span>&mdash;the Igorot says that toothache is
caused by a small worm twisting and turning in the tooth.</p>
<p>Igorot society contains no person who is so malevolent as to cause
another sickness, insanity, or death. So charitable is the
Igorot&rsquo;s view of his fellows that when, a few years ago, two
Bontoc men died of poison administered by another town, the verdict was
that the administering hands were directed by some vengeful or
diabolical <span lang="bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span>.</p>
<p>As a people the Bontoc Igorot are healthful. It is seldom that an
epidemic reaches them; bubonic plague and leprosy are unknown to
them.</p>
<p>By far the majority of deaths among them is due to what the Igorot
calls fever&mdash;as they say, &ldquo;<span lang="bo">im-po&prime;-os
nan a&prime;-wak</span>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;heat of the
body&rdquo;&mdash;but they class as &ldquo;fever&rdquo; half a dozen
serious diseases, some almost always fatal.</p>
<p>The men at times suffer with malaria. They go to the low west coast
as cargadors or as primitive merchants, and they return to their
mountain country enervated by the heat, their systems filled with
impure water, and their blood teeming with mosquito-planted malaria.
They get down with fever, lose their appetite, neither know the value
of nor have the medicines of civilization, their minds are often
poisoned with the superstitious belief that they will die&mdash;and
they do die in from three days to two months. In February, 1903, three
cargadors died within two weeks after returning from the coast.</p>
<p>Measles, chicken pox, typhus and typhoid fevers, and a disease
resulting from eating new rice are undifferentiated by the
Igorot&mdash;they are his &ldquo;fever.&rdquo; Measles and chicken pox
are generally fatal to children. Igorot pueblos promptly and
effectually quarantine against these diseases. When a settlement is
afflicted with either of them it shuts its doors to all
outsiders&mdash;even using force if necessary; but force is seldom
demanded, as other pueblos at once forbid their people to enter the
afflicted settlement. The ravages of typhus and typhoid fever may be
imagined among a people who have no remedies for them. The diseased
condition resulting each year from eating new rice has locally been
called &ldquo;rice cholera.&rdquo; During the months of June, July, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3467" href="#xd21e3467" name=
"xd21e3467">72</a>]</span>August&mdash;the two harvest months of rice
and the one following&mdash;considerable rice of the new crop is
annually eaten. If rice has been stored in the palay houses until it is
sweated it is in every way a healthful, nutritious food, but when eaten
before it sweats it often produces diarrhea, usually leading to an
acute bloody dysentery which is often followed by vomiting and a sudden
collapse&mdash;as in Asiatic cholera.</p>
<p>In 1893 smallpox, <span lang="bo">ful-t&acirc;ng&prime;</span>, came
to Bontoc with a Spanish soldier who was in the hospital from Quiangan.
Some five or six adults and sixty or seventy children died. The ravage
took half a dozen in a day, but the Igorot stamped out the plague by
self-isolation. They talked the situation over, agreed on a plan, and
were faithful to it. All the families not afflicted moved to the
mountains; the others remained to minister or be ministered to, as the
case might be. About thirty-five years ago smallpox wiped out a
considerable settlement of Bontoc, called <span lang=
"bo">La&prime;-nao</span>, situated nearer the river than are any
dwellings at present.</p>
<p>About thirty years ago cholera, <span lang=
"bo">p&#301;sh-ti&prime;</span>, visited the people, and fifty or more
deaths resulted.</p>
<p>Some twelve years ago <span lang="bo">ka-lag&prime;-nas</span>, an
unidentified disease, destroyed a great number of people, probably half
a hundred. Those afflicted were covered with small, itching festers,
had attacks of nausea, and death resulted in about three days.</p>
<p>Two women died in Bontoc in 1901 of beri-beri, called fu-tut. These
are the only cases known to have been there.</p>
<p>About ten years ago a man died from passing blood&mdash;an ailment
which the Igorot named literally &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">&#301;n-&#301;s&prime;-fo cha&prime;-la</span> or <span lang=
"bo">&#301;n-tay&prime;-es cha&prime;-la</span>.&rdquo; It was not
dysentery, as the person at no time had a diarrhea. He gradually
weakened from the loss of small amounts of blood until, in about a
year, he died.</p>
<p>The above are the only fatal diseases now in the common memory of
the pueblo of Bontoc.</p>
<p>It is believed 95 per cent of the people suffer at some time,
probably much of the time, with some skin disease. They say no one has
been known to die of any of these skin diseases, but they are weakening
and annoying. Itch, <span lang="bo">ku&prime;-l&#301;d</span>, is the
most common, and it takes an especially strong hold on the babes in
arms. This <span lang="bo">ku&prime;-l&#301;d</span> is not the
<span lang="bo">ko&prime;-lud</span> or gos-gos, the white scaly itch
found among the people surrounding those of the Bontoc culture area but
not known to exist within it.</p>
<p>Two or three people suffer with rheumatism, <span lang=
"bo">f&#301;g-f&#301;g</span>, but are seldom confined to their
homes.</p>
<p>One man has consumption, <span lang="bo">o&prime;-kat</span>. He has
been coughing five or six years, and is very thin and weak.</p>
<p>Diarrhea, or <span lang="bo">o-gi&prime;-&acirc;k</span>, frequently
makes itself felt, but for only one or two days at a time. It is most
common when the locusts swarm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3526"
href="#xd21e3526" name="xd21e3526">73</a>]</span>over the country, and
the people eat them abundantly for several days. They say no one, not
even a babe, ever died of diarrhea.</p>
<p>Two of the three prostitutes of Bontoc, the cast-off mistresses of
Spanish soldiers, have syphilis, or na-na. Formerly one civilian was
afflicted, and at present four or five of the Constabulary soldiers
have contracted the disease.</p>
<p><span lang="bo">Lang-&#301;ng&prime;-i</span>, a disease of sores
and ulcers on the lips, nostrils, and rectum, afflicted a few people
three or four years ago. This disease is very common in the pueblo of
<span lang="bo">Ta-kong&prime;</span>, but is reported as never causing
death.</p>
<p>Goiter, <span lang="bo">fi-k&#277;k&prime;</span> or <span lang=
"bo">f&#301;n-to&prime;-k&#277;l</span>, is quite common with adults,
and is more common with women than men.</p>
<p>Varicose veins, <span lang="bo">o&prime;-pat</span>, are not
uncommon on the calves of both men and women.</p>
<p>Many old people suffer greatly with toothache, called
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">pa-tug&prime; nan fob-a&prime;</span>.&rdquo;
They say it is caused by a small worm, <span lang=
"bo">fi&prime;-k&#301;s</span>, which wriggles and twists in the tooth.
When one has an aching tooth extracted he looks at it and inquires
where &ldquo;<span lang="bo">fi&prime;-k&#301;s</span>&rdquo; is.</p>
<p>They suffer little from colds, <span lang="bo">mo-tug&prime;</span>,
and one rarely hears an Igorot cough.</p>
<p>Headache, called both <span lang="bo">sa-k&#301;t&prime; si
o&prime;-lo</span> and <span lang="bo">pa-tug&prime; si
o&prime;-lo</span>, rarely occurs except with fever.</p>
<p>Sore eyes, a condition known as <span lang=
"bo">&#301;n-o&prime;-ki</span>, are very frequently seen; they
doubtless precede most cases of blindness.</p>
<p>The Igorot bears pain well, but his various fatalistic superstitions
make him often an easy victim to a malady that would yield readily to
the science of modern medicine and from which, in the majority of
cases, he would probably recover if his mind could only assist his body
in withstanding the disease.</p>
<p>One is surprised to find that sores from bruises do not generally
heal quickly.</p>
<p>The Igorot attempts no therapeutic remedies for fevers, cholera,
beri-beri, rheumatism, consumption, diarrhea, syphilis, goiter, colds,
or sore eyes.</p>
<p>Some effort, therapeutic in its intent, is made to assist nature in
overcoming a few of the simplest ailments of the body.</p>
<p>For a cut, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">na-fa&prime;-kag</span>,&rdquo; the fruit of a grass-like herb
named <span lang="bo">la-lay&prime;-ya</span> is pounded to a paste,
and then bound on the wound.</p>
<p>Burns, <span lang="bo">ma-la-f&ucirc;b-chong&prime;</span>, are
covered over with a piece of bark from a tree called <span lang=
"bo">ta-kum&prime;-fao</span>.</p>
<p><span lang="bo">Kay-yub&prime;</span>, a vegetable root, is rubbed
over the forehead in cases of headache.</p>
<p>Boils, <span lang="bo">fu-yu-i&prime;</span>, and swellings,
<span lang="bo">nay-am-an&prime;</span> or <span lang=
"bo">k&#301;n-may-yon&prime;</span>, are treated with a poultice of a
pounded herb called <span lang="bo">ok-ok-ong&prime;-an</span>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3622" href="#xd21e3622" name=
"xd21e3622">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>Millet burned to a charcoal, pulverized, and mixed with pig fat is
used as a salve for the itch.</p>
<p>An herb called <span lang="bo">a-k&ucirc;m&prime;</span> is pounded
and used as a poultice on ulcers and sores.</p>
<p>For toothache salt is mixed with a pounded herb named <span lang=
"bo">ot-o&prime;-t&#277;k</span> and the mass put in or around the
aching tooth.</p>
<p>Leaves of the tree <span lang="bo">kay&prime;-yam</span> are
steeped, and the decoction employed as a bath for persons with
smallpox.</p>

<h3 class="main">Death and burial</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It must be said that the Bontoc Igorot does not take
death very sorrowfully, and he does not take it at all passionately. A
mother weeps a day for a dead child or her husband, but death is said
not to bring tears from any man. Death causes no long or loud
lamentation, no tearing of the hair or cutting the body; it effects no
somber colors to deaden the emotions; no earth or ashes for the
body&mdash;all widespread mourning customs among primitive peoples.
However, when a child or mature man or woman dies the women assemble
and sing and wail a melancholy dirge, and they ask the departed why he
went so early. But for the aged there are neither tears nor
wailings&mdash;there is only grim philosophy. &ldquo;You were
old,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;and old people die. You are dead, and now
we shall place you in the earth. We too are old, and soon we shall
follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All people die at the instance of an anito. There have been,
however, three suicides in Bontoc. Many years ago an old man and woman
hung themselves in their dwellings because they were old and infirm,
and a man from Bitwagan hung himself in the Spanish jail at Bontoc a
few years ago.</p>
<p>The spirit of the person who dies a so-called natural death is
called away by an anito. The anito of those who die in battle receive
the special name &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">p&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime;</span>&rdquo;; such spirits are not
called away, but the person&rsquo;s slayer is told by some <span lang=
"bo">p&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime;</span>, &ldquo;You must take a
head.&rdquo; So it may be said that no death occurs among the Igorot
(except the rare death by suicide) which is not due directly to an
anito.</p>
<p>Since they are warriors, the men who die in battle are the most
favored, but if not killed in battle all Igorot prefer to die in their
houses. Should they die elsewhere, they are at once taken home.</p>
<p>On March 19, 1903, wise, rich <span lang="bo">Som-kad&prime;</span>,
of ato Luwakan, and the oldest man of Bontoc, heard an anito saying,
&ldquo;Come, <span lang="bo">Som-kad&prime;</span>; it is much better
in the mountains; come.&rdquo; The sick old man laboriously walked from
the pabafunan to the house of his oldest son, where he had for nearly
twenty years taken his food, and there among his children and friends
he died on the night of March 21. Just before he died a chicken was
killed, and the old people gathered at the house, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3668" href="#xd21e3668" name=
"xd21e3668">75</a>]</span>cooked the chicken, and ate, inviting the
ancestral anitos and the departing spirit of <span lang=
"bo">Som-kad&prime;</span> to the feast. Shortly after this the spirit
of the live man passed from the body searching the mountain spirit land
for kin and friend. They closed the old man&rsquo;s eyes, washed his
body and on it put the blue burial robe with the white
&ldquo;anito&rdquo; figures woven in it as a stripe. They fashioned a
rude, high-back chair with a low seat, a <span lang=
"bo">sung-a&prime;-chil</span> (<a href="#pl041">Pl. XLI</a>), and
bound the dead man in it, fastening him by bands about the waist, the
arms, and head&mdash;the vegetal band entirely covering the open mouth.
His hands were laid in his lap. The chair was set close up before the
door of the house, with the corpse facing out. Four nights and days it
remained there in full sight of those who passed.</p>
<p>One-half the front wall of the dwelling and the interior partitions
except the sleeping compartment were removed to make room for those who
sat in the dwelling. Most of these came and went without function, but
day and night two young women sat or stood beside the corpse always
brushing away the flies which sought to gather at its nostrils.</p>
<p>During the first two days few men were about the house, but they
gathered in small groups in the vicinity of the fawi and pabafunan,
which were only <span class="measure" title="15 or 20 meters">three or
four rods</span> distant. Much of the time a blind son of the dead man,
the owner of the house where the old man died, sat on his haunches in
the shade under the low roof, and at frequent intervals sang to a
melancholy tune that his father was dead, that his father could no
longer care for him, and that he would be lonely without him. On
succeeding days other of the dead man&rsquo;s children, three sons and
five daughters, all rich and with families of their own, were heard to
sing the same words. Small numbers of women sat about the front of the
house or close in the shade of its roof and under its cover. Now and
then some one or more of them sang a low-voiced, wordless
song&mdash;rather a soothing strain than a depressing dirge. During the
first days the old women, and again the old men, sang at different
times alone the following song, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">a-na&prime;-ko</span>&rdquo; when sung by the women, and
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">e-ya&prime;-e</span>&rdquo; when by the men:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Now you are dead; we are all here to see you. We have
given you all things necessary, and have made good preparation for the
burial. Do not come to call away [to kill] any of your relatives or
friends.</p>
</div>
<p>Nowhere was there visible any sign of fear or awe or wonder. The
women sitting about spun threads on their thighs for making skirts;
they talked and laughed and sang at will. Mothers nursed their babes in
the dwelling and under its projecting roof. Budding girls patted and
loved and dimpled the cheeks of the squirming babes of more fortunate
young women, and there was scarcely a child that passed in or out of
the house, that did not have to steady itself by laying a hand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3699" href="#xd21e3699" name=
"xd21e3699">76</a>]</span>on the lap of the corpse. All seemed to
understand death. One, they say, does not die until the anito
calls&mdash;and then one always goes into a goodly life which the old
men often see and tell about.</p>
<p>In a well-organized and developed modern enterprise the death of a
principal man causes little or no break. This is equally true in Igorot
life. The former is so because of perfected organization&mdash;there
are new men trained for all machines; and the latter is true because of
absence of organization&mdash;there is almost no machinery to be left
unattended by the falling of one person.</p>
<p>On the third day the numbers increased. There were twenty-five or
thirty men in the vicinity of the house, on the south side of which
were half a dozen pots of basi,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3705src"
href="#xd21e3705" name="xd21e3705src">11</a> from which men and boys
drank at pleasure, though not half a dozen became intoxicated. Late in
the afternoon a double row of men, the sons and sons-in-law of the
deceased, lined up on their haunches facing one another, and for half
an hour talked and laughed, counted on their fingers and gesticulated,
diagrammed on their palms, questioned, pointed with their lips and
nodded, as they divided the goodly property of the dead man. There was
no anger, no sharp word, or apparent dissent; all seemed to know
exactly what was each one&rsquo;s right. In about half an hour the
property was disposed of beyond probable future dispute.</p>
<p>There were more women present the third day than on the second, and
at all times about one-third more women than men; and there were
usually as many children about as there were grown persons. In all the
group of, say, 140 people, nowhere could one detect a sign of the
uncanny, or even the unusual. The apparent everydayness of it all to
them was what struck the observer most. The young women brushing away
the flies touched and turned the fast-blackening hands of the corpse to
note the rapid changes. Almost always there were small children
standing in the doorway looking into that blackened, swollen face, and
they turned away only to play or to loll about their mothers&rsquo;
necks. Always there were women bending over other women&rsquo;s heads,
carefully parting the hair and scanning it. Women lay asleep stretched
in the shade; they talked, and droned, and laughed, and spun.</p>
<p>During the second day men had succeeded in catching in the mountains
one of the half-wild carabaos&mdash;property of the deceased&mdash;and
this was killed. Its head was placed in the house tied up by the horns
above and facing <span lang="bo">Som-kad&prime;</span>, so the faces of
the dead seemed looking at each other, while on the third day the
flesh, bones, intestines, and hide were cooked for the crowd. During
the third and fourth days one carabao, one dog, eight hogs, and twenty
chickens were killed, cooked, and eaten.</p>
<p>On the fourth day the crowd increased. Custom lays idle all field
tools of an ato on the burial day of an adult of that ato; but the day
Som-kad&prime; was buried the field work of the entire pueblo stood
still <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3718" href="#xd21e3718" name=
"xd21e3718">77</a>]</span>because of common respect for this man, so
old and wise, so rich and influential, and probably 200 people were
about the house all the day. By noon two well-defined groups of
chanting old women had formed&mdash;one sitting in the house and the
other in front of it. Wordless, melancholy chants were sung in response
between the groups. The spaces surrounding the house became almost
packed&mdash;so much so that a dog succeeded in getting into the
doorway, and the threatenings and maledictions that drove it away were
the loudest, most disturbed expressions noted during the four days.</p>
<p>Before the house, which faced the west, lay the large pine coffin
lid, while to the south of it, turned bottom up, was the coffin with
fresh chips beside it hewn out that morning in further excavation.
Children played around the coffin and people lounged on its upturned
bottom. Near the front of the house a pot of water was always hot over
a <span class="corr" title="Source: smouldering">smoldering</span>,
smoking fire. Now and then a chicken was brought, light wood was tossed
under the pot, the chicken was beaten to death&mdash;first the wings,
then the neck, and then the head. The fowl was quickly sprawled over
the blaze, its feathers burned to a crisp, and rubbed off with sticks.
Its legs were severed from the body with the battle-ax and put in the
pot. From its front it was then cut through its ribs with one gash. The
back and breast parts were torn apart, the gall examined and nodded
over; the intestines were placed beneath a large rock, and the gizzard,
breast of the chicken, and back with head attached dropped in the pot.
During the killing and dressing neither of the two men who prepared the
feast hurried, yet scarcely five minutes passed from the time the first
blow was struck on the wing of the squawking fowl until the work was
over and the meat in the boiling pot. The cooking of a fowl always
brought a crowd of boys who hung over the fragrant vessel, and they
usually got their share when, in about twenty minutes, the meat came
forth. Three times in the afternoon a fowl was thus distributed. Cooked
pork was passed among the people, and rice was always being brought.
Twice a man went through the crowd with a large winnowing tray of
cooked carabao hide cut in little blocks. This food was handed out on
every side, people tending children receiving double share. The people
gathered and ate in the congested spaces about the dwelling. The heat
was intense&mdash;there was scarcely a breath of air stirring. The odor
from the body was heavy and most sickening to an American, and yet
there was no trace of the unusual on the various faces.</p>
<p>New arrivals came to take their last look at <span lang=
"bo">Som-kad&prime;</span>, now a black, bloated, inhuman-looking
thing, and they turned away apparently unaffected by the sight.</p>
<p>The sun slid down behind the mountain ridge lying close to the
pueblo, and a dozen men armed with digging sticks and dirt baskets
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3732" href="#xd21e3732" name=
"xd21e3732">78</a>]</span>filed along the trail some <span class=
"measure" title="75 meters">fifteen rods</span> to the last fringe of
houses. There they dug a grave in a small, unused sementera plat where
only the old, rich men of the pueblo are buried. A group of twenty-five
old women gathered standing at the front of the house swaying to the
right, to the left, as they slowly droned in melancholy cadence:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">You were old, and old people die. You are dead, and
now we shall place you in the earth. We too are old, and soon we shall
follow you.</p>
</div>
<p>Again and again they droned, and when they ceased others within the
house took up the strain. During the singing the carabao head was
brought from the house, and the horns, with small section of attached
skull, chopped out, and the head returned to the ceiling of the
dwelling.</p>
<p>Presently a man came with a slender stick to measure the coffin. He
drove a nursing mother, with a woman companion and small child, from
comfortable seats on the upturned wood. The people, including the group
of old women, were driven away from the front of the house, the coffin
was laid down on the ground before the door, and an unopened
<span class="measure" title="30-liter">8-gallon</span> olla of
&ldquo;preserved&rdquo; meat was set at its foot. An old woman, in no
way distinguishable from the others by paraphernalia or other marks,
muttering, squatted beside the olla. Two men untied the bands from the
corpse, and one lifted it free from the chair and carried it in his
arms to the coffin. It was most unsightly, and streams of rusty-brown
liquid ran from it. It was placed face up, head elevated even with the
rim, and legs bent close at the knees but only slightly at the hips.
The old woman arose from beside the olla and helped lay two new
breechcloths and a blanket over the body. The face was left uncovered,
except that a small patch of white cloth ravelings, called
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">fo-ot&prime;</span>,&rdquo; was laid over the
eyes, and a small white cloth was laid over the hair of the head. The
burden was quickly caught up on men&rsquo;s shoulders and hurried
without halting to the grave. Willing bands swarmed about the coffin.
At all times as many men helped bear it as could well get hold, and
when they mounted the face of a <span class="measure" title=
"2-meter">7-foot</span> sementera wall a dozen strong pairs of hands
found service drawing up and supporting the burden. Many men followed
from the house one brought the coffin cover and another the carabao
horns&mdash;but the women and children remained behind, as is their
custom at burials.</p>
<p>At the grave the coffin rested on the earth a moment<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3756src" href="#xd21e3756" name=
"xd21e3756src">12</a> while a few more basketfuls of dirt were thrown
out, until the grave was about <span class="measure" title=
"150 centimeters">5 feet</span> deep. The coffin was then placed in the
grave, the cover laid on, and with a joke and a laugh the pair of horns
was placed facing it at the head. Instantly thirty-two men sprang on
the piles of fresh, loose dirt, and with their hands and the half dozen
digging sticks filled and covered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3762" href="#xd21e3762" name="xd21e3762">79</a>]</span>the grave
in the shortest possible time, probably not over one minute and a half.
And away they hurried, most of them at a dogtrot, to wash themselves in
the river.</p>
<p>From the instant the corpse was in the coffin until the grave was
filled all things were done in the greatest haste, because cawing crows
must not fly over, dogs must not bark, snakes or rats must not cross
the trail&mdash;if they should, some dire evil would follow.</p>
<p>Shortly after the burial a ceremony, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">kap-i-yan si na-t&uuml;&prime;</span>,&rdquo; is performed by the
relatives in the dwelling wherein the corpse sat. It is said to be the
last ceremony given for the dead. Food is eaten and the one in charge
addresses the anito of the dead man as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">We have fixed all things right and well for you. When
there was no rice or chicken for food, we got them for you&mdash;as was
the custom of our fathers&mdash;so you will not come to make us sick.
If another anito seeks to harm us, you will protect us. When we make a
feast and ask you to come to it, we want you to do so; but if another
anito kills all your relatives, there will be no more houses for you to
enter for feasts.</p>
</div>
<p>This last argument is considered to be a very important one, as all
Igorot are fond of feasting, and it is assumed that the anito has the
same desire.</p>
<p>The night following the burial all relatives stay at the house
lately occupied by the corpse.</p>
<p>On the day after the burial all the men relatives go to the river
and catch fish, the small kacho. The relatives have a fish feast,
called &ldquo;<span lang="bo">ab-a-fon&prime;</span>,&rdquo; at the
hour of the evening meal. To this feast all ancestral anito are
invited.</p>
<p>All relatives again spend the night at the house, from which they
return to their own dwellings after breakfast of the second day and
each goes laden with a plate of cooked rice.</p>
<p>In this way from two to eight days are given to the funeral rite,
the duration being greater with the wealthier people.</p>
<p>Only heads of families are buried in the large pine coffins, which
are kept ready stored beside the granaries everywhere about the pueblo.
As in the case of <span lang="bo">Som-kad&prime;</span>, all old, rich
men are buried in a plat of ground close to the last fringe of
dwellings on the west of the pueblo, but all other persons except those
who lose their heads are buried close to their dwellings in the camote
sementeras.</p>
<p>The burial clothes of a married man are the <span lang=
"bo">los-a&prime;-dan</span>, or blue anito-figured burial robe, and a
breechcloth of beaten bark, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">chi-nang-ta&prime;</span>.&rdquo; In the coffin are placed a
fa&prime;-a, or blue cotton breechcloth made in Titipan, the
fan-cha&prime;-la, a striped blue-and-white cotton blanket, and the
to-chong&prime;, a <span class="measure" title=
"30 centimeter-square">foot-square</span> piece of beaten bark or white
cloth which is laid on the head.</p>
<p>A married woman is buried in a <span lang=
"bo">kay-&#301;n&prime;</span>, a particular skirt made for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3813" href="#xd21e3813" name=
"xd21e3813">80</a>]</span>burial in Titipan, and a white blue-bordered
<span class="corr" title="Source: waist">waistcloth</span> or la-ma. In
the coffin are placed a burial girdle, <span lang=
"bo">w&acirc;&prime;-k&#301;s</span>, also made in Titipan, a
blue-and-white-striped blanket called <span lang=
"bo">bay-a-ong&prime;</span>, and the <span lang=
"bo">to-chong&prime;</span>, the small cloth or bark over the hair.</p>
<p>The unmarried are buried in graves near the dwelling, and these are
walled up the sides and covered with rocks and lastly with earth; it is
the old rock cairn instead of the wooden coffin. The bodies are placed
flat on their backs with knees bent and heels drawn up to the buttocks.
With the men are buried, besides the things interred with the married
men, the basket-work hat, the basket-work sleeping hat, the spear, the
battle-ax, and the earrings if any are possessed. These additional
things are buried, they say, because there is no family with which to
leave them, though all things interred are for the use of the anito of
the dead.</p>
<p>In addition to the various things buried with the married woman, the
unmarried has a sleeping hat.</p>
<p>Babes and children up to 6 or 7 years of age are buried in the
sementera wrapped in a crude beaten-bark mantle. This garment is folded
and wrapped about the body, and for babes, at least, is bound and tied
close about them.</p>
<p>Babies are buried close to the dwelling where the sun and storm do
not beat, because, as they say, babes are too tender to receive harsh
treatment.</p>
<p>For those beheaded in battle there is another burial, which is
described in a later chapter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3842"

Godwin-Austen says of the G&#257;ro hill tribes, Bengal, India:</p>

&lsquo;bolbang,&rsquo; or young men&rsquo;s house. <span class="corr"
title="Source: * * *">&hellip;</span> In this house all the unmarried
males live, as soon as they attain the age of puberty, and in this any
travelers are put up.&rdquo;&mdash;The Journal of the Anthropological
Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, vol. II, p. 393. See also op.
cit., vol. XI, p. 199.</p>
<p class="footnote">S. E. Peal says:</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Barracks for the unmarried young men are
common in and around Assam among non-Aryan races. The institution is
here seen in various stages of decline or transition. In the case of
&lsquo;head-hunters&rsquo; the young men&rsquo;s barracks are
invariably guardhouses, at the entrance to the village, and those on
guard at night keep tally of the men who leave and
return.&rdquo;&mdash;Op. cit., vol. XXII, p. 248.</p>
<p class="footnote">Gertrude M. Godden writes at length of the young
men&rsquo;s house of the N&aacute;g&aacute; and other frontier tribes
of northeast India: &ldquo;Before leaving the N&aacute;g&aacute; social
customs one prominent feature of their village society must be noticed.
This is the <i>dekha chang</i>, an institution in some respects similar
to the bachelors&rsquo; hall of the Melanesians, which again is
compared with the <i>balai</i> and other public halls of the Malay
Archipelago. This building, also called a <i>Morang</i>, was used for
the double purpose of a sleeping place for the young men and as a guard
or watch house for the village. The custom of the young men sleeping
together is one that is constantly noticed in accounts of the
N&aacute;g&aacute; tribes, and a like custom prevailed in some, if not
all, cases for the girls. <span class="corr" title=
"Source: * * *">&hellip;</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2699" href="#xd21e2699" name="xd21e2699">53</a>]</span>&ldquo;The
young men&rsquo;s hall is variously described and named. An article in
the Journal of the Indian Archipelago, 1848, says that among the
N&aacute;g&aacute;s the bachelors&rsquo; hall of the Dayak village is
found under the name of &lsquo;Mooring.&rsquo; In this all the boys of
the age of 9 or 10 upward reside apart. In a report of 1854 the
&lsquo;morungs&rsquo; are described as large buildings generally
situated at the principal entrances and varying in number according to
the size of the village; they are in fact the main guardhouse, and here
all the young unmarried men sleep. In front of the morung is a raised
platform as a lookout, commanding an extensive view of all approaches,
where a N&aacute;g&aacute; is always kept on duty as a sentry.
<span class="corr" title="Source: * * *">&hellip;</span> In the Morungs
are kept skulls carried off in battle; these are suspended by a string
along the wall in one or more rows over each other. In one of the
Morungs of the Changuae village, Captain Brodie counted one hundred and
thirty skulls. <span class="corr" title="Source: * * *">&hellip;</span>
Besides these there was a large basket full of broken pieces of skulls.
Captain Holroyd, from whose memorandum the above is quoted, speaks
later of the Morung as the &lsquo;hall of justice&rsquo; in which the
consultations of the clan council are held.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;The <i>&lsquo;Morangs&rsquo;</i> of another
tribe, the &lsquo;Naked&rsquo; N&aacute;g&aacute;, have recently been
described as situated close to the village gate, and consist of a
central hall, and back and front <span class="corr" title=
"Source: verandas">verandahs</span>. In the large front <span class=
"corr" title="Source: veranda">verandah</span> are collected all the
trophies of war and the chase, from a man&rsquo;s skull down to a
monkey&rsquo;s. Along both sides of the central hall are the sleeping
berths of the young men. <span class="corr" title=
"Source: * * *">&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Speaking of the Mao and Muran tribes
[continues Miss Godden], Dr. Brown says, &lsquo;the young men never
sleep at home, but at their clubs, where they keep their arms always in
a state of readiness.&rsquo; <span class="corr" title=
"Source: * * *">&hellip;</span></p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;With the Aos at the present day the custom
seems to be becoming obsolete; sleeping houses are provided for
bachelors, but are seldom used except by small boys. Unmarried girls
sleep by twos and threes in houses otherwise empty, or else tenanted by
one old woman.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;The analogy between the <i>Dakha Chang</i>,
or <i>Morang</i>, of the N&aacute;g&aacute;s and the men&rsquo;s hall
of the Melanesians is too close to be overlooked, and in view of the
significance of all evidence concerning the corporate life of early
communities a description of the latter is here quoted. I am aware of
no recorded instance of the women&rsquo;s house, other than these
N&aacute;g&aacute; examples. &lsquo;In all the Melanesian groups it is
the rule that there is in every village a building of public character
where the men eat and spend their time, the young men sleep, strangers
are entertained; where as in the Solomon Islands the canoes are kept;
where images are seen, and from which women are generally excluded;
<span class="corr" title="Source: * * *">&hellip;</span> and all these
no doubt correspond to the balai and other public halls of the Malay
Archipelago.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&mdash;Op. cit., vol. XXVI, pp.
179&ndash;182.</p>
<p class="footnote">Similar institutions appear to exist also in
Sumatra.</p>
<p class="footnote">In Borneo among the Land Dyaks &ldquo;head
houses,&rdquo; called &ldquo;pangah,&rdquo; are found in each village.
Low says of them: &ldquo;The Pangah is built by the united efforts of
the boys and unmarried men of the tribe, who, after having attained the
age of puberty, are obliged to leave the houses of the village; and do
not generally frequent them after they have attained the age of 8 or 9
years.&rdquo;&mdash;Sir Hugh Low, Sarawak, its Inhabitants and
Productions (London, 1848), p. 280.</p>
<p class="footnote">Lieutenant F. Elton writes of the natives of
Solomon Islands: &ldquo;In every village they have at least one
so-called tamboo house of <i>tohe,</i> generally the largest building
in the settlement. This is only for the men, it being death for a
female to enter there. It is used as a public place and belongs to the
community. Any stranger coming to the village goes to the tamboo house
and remains there until the person he is in quest of meets him
there.&rdquo;&mdash;The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of
Great Britain and Ireland, vol. XVII, p. 97.</p>
<p class="footnote">Mr. H. O. Forbes writes of the tribes of Timor
(islands between New Guinea and Australia) that they have a building
called &ldquo;Uma-lulik.&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;The <i>lulik</i> can be
at once recognized, were it by nothing else than by the buffalo crania
with which it is decorated on the outside.&rdquo; An officer who holds
one of the highest and certainly the most influential positions in the
kingdom has charge of the building, and presides over the sacred rites
which are conducted in them. <span class="corr" title=

person, sometimes by a man and his wife, but they must not
both&mdash;being of opposite sex&mdash;stay all night.&rdquo;&mdash;Op.

considered the various activities which a political economist would
consider if he studied a modern community&mdash;in so far as they occur
in Bontoc. This method was chosen not to make the Bontoc Igorot appear
a modern man but that the student may see as plainly as method will
allow on what economic plane the Bontoc man lives. The desire for this
clear view is prompted by the belief that grades of culture of

<h4 class="main">Natural production</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It would be impossible for the Bontoc Igorot at
present to subsist themselves two weeks by natural production. It is
doubtful whether at any time they could have depended for even as much
as a day in a week on the natural foods of the Bontoc culture area. The
country has wild carabaos, deer, hogs, chickens, and three animals
which the Igorot calls &ldquo;cats,&rdquo; but all of these, when
considered as a food supply for the people, are relatively scarce, and
it is thought they were never much more abundant than now. Fish are not
plentiful, and judging from the available waters there are probably as
many now as formerly. It is believed that no nut foods are eaten in
Bontoc, although an acorn is found in the mountains to the south of
Bontoc pueblo. The banana and pineapple now grow wild within the area,
but they are not abundant. Of small berries, such as are so abundant in
the wild lands of the United States, there are almost none in the area.
On the outside, near Suyak of Lepanto, there is a huckleberry found so
plentifully that they claim it is gathered for food in its season.</p>

<h5 class="main">Hunting</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A large pile of rocks stands like a compact fortress
on the mountain horizon to the north of Bontoc pueblo. Here a ceremony
is observed twice annually by rich men for the increase of
ay-ya-wan&prime;, the wild <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3861"
href="#xd21e3861" name="xd21e3861">82</a>]</span>carabao. It is claimed
that there are now seventeen wild carabaos in Ma-ka&prime;-lan Mountain
near the pueblo. There are others in the mountains farther to the north
and east, and the ceremony has among its objects that of inducing these
more distant herds to migrate to the public lands surrounding the
pueblo.</p>
<p>The men go to the great rock, which is said to be a transformed
anito, and there they build a fire, eat a meal, and have the ceremony
called &ldquo;mang-a-pu&prime;-i si ay-ya-wan&prime;,&rdquo; freely,
&ldquo;fire-feast for wild carabaos.&rdquo; The ceremony is as
follows:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ay-ya-w&aacute;n ad Sa-ka&prime;-pa a-li-k&aacute;
is-n&aacute; ma-am&prime;-mung is-n&aacute;.</p>
<p class="line">Ay-ya-w&aacute;n ad O-ki-k&iacute; a-li-k&aacute;
is-n&aacute; ma-am&prime;-mung is-n&aacute;.</p>
<p class="line">Fay-cha&prime;-mi ya&prime;-i nan a-pu&prime;-i ya
pa&prime;-tay.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This is an invitation addressed to the wild carabaos
of the Sakapa and Okiki Mountains to come in closer to Bontoc. They are
also asked to note that a fire-feast is made in their honor.</p>
<p>The old men say that probably 500 wild carabaos have been killed by
the men of the pueblo. There is a tradition that Lumawig instructed the
people to kill wild carabaos for marriage feasts, and all of those
killed&mdash;of which there is memory or tradition&mdash;have been used
in the marriage feasts of the rich. The wild carabao is extremely
vicious, and is killed only when forty or fifty men combine and hunt it
with spears. When wounded it charges any man in sight, and the
hunter&rsquo;s only safety is in a tree.</p>
<p>The method of hunting is simple. The herd is located, and as
cautiously as possible the hunters conceal themselves behind the trees
near the runway and throw their spears as the desired animal passes. No
wild carabaos have been killed during the past two years, but I am told
that the numbers killed three, four, six, seven, and eight years ago
were, respectively, 5, 8, 7, 10, and 8.</p>
<p>Seven men in Bontoc have dogs trained to run deer and wild boar. One
of the men, Aliwang, has a pack of five dogs; the others have one or
two each. The hunting dogs are small and only moderately fleet, but
they are said to have great courage and endurance. They hunt out of
leash, and still-hunt until they start their prey, when they cry
continually, thus directing the hunter to the runway or the place where
the victim is at bay.</p>
<p>Not more than one deer, og&prime;-sa, is killed annually, and they
claim that deer were always very scarce in the area. A large net
<span class="measure" title="about a meter">some 3&frac12; feet</span>
high and often <span class="measure" title="15 meters">50 feet</span>
long is commonly employed in northern Luzon and through the Archipelago
for netting deer and hogs, but no such net is used in Bontoc. The dogs
follow the deer, and the hunter spears it in the runway as it passes
him or while held at bay.</p>
<p>The wild hog, la&prime;-man or fang&prime;-o, when hunted with dogs
is a surly fighter and prefers to take its chances at bay; consequently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3890" href="#xd21e3890" name=
"xd21e3890">83</a>]</span>it is more often killed then by the spearman
than in the runway. The wild hog is also often caught in pitfalls dug
in the runways or in its feeding grounds. The pitfall, fi&prime;-to, is
from <span class="measure" title="90 to 120 centimeters">3 to 4
feet</span> across, about <span class="measure" title=
"120 centimeters">4 feet</span> deep, and is covered over with dry
grass.</p>
<p>In the forest feeding grounds of Polus Mountains, between the Bontoc
culture area and the Banawi area to the south, these pitfalls are very
abundant, there frequently being two or three within a space
<span class="measure" title="5 meters square">one rod
square</span>.</p>
<p>A deadfall, called &ldquo;&#301;l-t&#301;b&prime;,&rdquo; is built
for hogs near the sementeras in the mountains. These deadfalls are
quite common throughout the Bontoc area, and probably capture more hogs
than the pitfall and the hunter combined. The hogs are partial to
growing palay and camotes, and at night circle about a protecting fence
anxious to take advantage of any chance opening. The Igorot leaves an
opening in a low fence built especially for that purpose, as he does
not commonly fence in the sementeras. The &#301;l-t&#301;b&prime; is
built of two sections of heavy tree trunks, one imbedded in the earth,
level with the ground, and the other the falling timber. As the hog
enters the sementera, the weight of his body springs the trigger which
is covered in the loose dirt before the opening, and the falling timber
pins him fast against the lower timber firmly buried in the earth. From
half a dozen to twenty wild hogs are annually killed by the people of
the pueblo. They are said to be as plentiful as formerly.</p>
<p>Bontoc pueblo does not catch many wild fowls. Fowl catching is an
art she never learned to follow, although two or three of her boys
annually catch half a dozen chickens each. The surrounding pueblos, as
Tukukan, Sakasakan, Mayinit, and Maligkong, secure every year in the
neighborhood of fifty to one hundred fowl each. The
sa&prime;-f&ucirc;g, or wild cock, is most commonly caught in a snare,
called &ldquo;shi&prime;-ay,&rdquo; to which it is lured by another
cock, a domestic one, or often a half-breed or a wild cock partially
domesticated, which is secured inside the snare set up in the mountains
near the feeding grounds of the wild fowls.</p>
<p>The shi&prime;-ay when set consists of twenty-four si&prime;-lu, or
running loops, attached to a cord forming three sides of an open square
space. As the snare is set the open side is placed against a rock or
steep base of a rise. The shi&prime;-ay is made of braided bejuco, and
when not in use, is compactly packed away in a basket for the purpose
(see <a href="#pl044">Pl. XLIV</a>). There are also five pegs fitted
into loops in the basket, four of which are employed in pegging out the
three sides of the snare, and the other for securing the lure cock
within the square. Only cocks are caught with the shi&prime;-ay, and
they come to fight the intruder who guides them to the snare by crowing
his challenge. As the wild cock rushes at the other he is caught by one
of the loops closing about him. The hunter, always hiding within
<span class="measure" title="one or two meters">a few feet</span> of
the snare, rushes upon the captive, and at once resets his snare for
another possible victim. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3916" href=
"#xd21e3916" name="xd21e3916">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>A spring snare, called kok-o&prime;-l&acirc;ng, is employed by the
Igorot in catching both wild cocks and hens. It is set in their narrow
runways in the heavy undergrowth. It consists of two short uprights
driven into the ground one on either side of the path. These are bound
together at the tops with two crosspieces. Near the lower ends of these
uprights is a loose crosspiece, the trigger, which the fowl in passing
knocks down, thus freeing the short upright, marked <i>c</i>, in
<a href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>. When this is freed the loop, <i>e,</i> at
once tightens around the victim, as the cord is drawn taut by the
releasing of the spring&mdash;a shrub bent over and secured by the
upper end of the cord. This spring is not shown in the drawing.</p>

<p>Bontoc has two or three quadrupeds which it names
&ldquo;cats.&rdquo; One of these is a true cat, called in&prime;-yao.
It is domesticated by the Ilokano in Bontoc and becomes a good
mouser.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3949src" href="#xd21e3949" name=
"xd21e3949src">1</a> The kok-o&prime;-l&acirc;ng is used to catch this
cat. <a href="#pl046">Pl. XLVI</a> shows with what success this spring
snare may be employed. The cat shown was caught in the night while
trying to enter a chicken coop. He was a wild in&prime;-yao, was
beautifully striped like the American &ldquo;tiger cat,&rdquo; and
measured <span class="measure" title="89 centimeters">35 inches</span>
from tip to tip. The in&prime;-yao is plentiful in the mountains, and
is greatly relished by the Igorot, though Bontoc has no professional
cat hunters and probably not a dozen of the animals are captured
annually.</p>
<p>The Igorot claim to have two other &ldquo;cats,&rdquo; one called
&ldquo;co&prime;-lang,&rdquo; as large as in&prime;-yao, with large
legs and very large feet. A Spaniard living near Sagada says this
animal eats his coffee berries. The other so-called &ldquo;cat&rdquo;
is named &ldquo;si&prime;-le&rdquo; by the Igorot. It is said to be a
long-tailed, dark-colored animal, smaller than the in&prime;-yao. It is
claimed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3960" href="#xd21e3960"
name="xd21e3960">85</a>]</span>that this si&prime;-le is both
carnivorous and frugivorous. These two animals are trapped at times,
and when caught are eaten.</p>
<p>During the year the boys catch numbers of small birds, all of which
are eaten. Probably not over 200 are captured, however, during a
year.</p>
<p>The ling-an&prime;, a spring snare, is the most used for catching
birds. I saw one of them catch four shrikes, called ta&prime;-la, in a
single afternoon, and a fifth one was caught early the next morning.
<a href="#pl047">Pl. XLVII</a> shows the ling-an&prime; as it is set,
and also shows ta&prime;-la as he is caught.</p>
<p>The kok-o&prime;-l&acirc;ng is also employed successfully for such
birds as run on the ground, especially those which run in paths. The
si-s&#301;m&prime; is another spring snare set on the open ground. Food
is scattered about leading to it, and is placed abundantly in an
inclosure, the entrance to which is through the fatal noose which
tightens when the bird perches on the trigger at the opening to the
inclosure.</p>
<p>When the palay is in the milk a great many birds which feed upon it
are captured by means of a broom-like bundle of runo. As the birds fly
over the sementeras a boy sweeps his broom, the ka-l&#301;b&prime;,
through the flock, and rarely fails to knock down a bird. The
ka-l&#301;b&prime; is about <span class="measure" title="2 meters">7
feet</span> long, <span class="measure" title="6 centimeters">2&frac12;
inches</span> in diameter at the base, and flattened and broadened to
<span class="measure" title="35 or 38 centimeters">14 or 15
inches</span> in width at the outer end. What the ka-l&#301;b&prime;
really does for the boy is to give him an arm about <span class=

hand <span class="measure" title="40 centimeters">a foot and a
quarter</span> wide.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main">Fishing</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The only water available to Bontoc pueblo for fishing
purposes is the river passing between it and her sister pueblo, Samoki.
In the dry season, where it is not dammed, the river is not over
<span class="measure" title="30 or 40 meters">six and eight rods</span>
across in its widest places, and is from <span class="measure" title=
"few centimeters">a few inches</span> to <span class="measure" title=
"a meter">3 feet</span> deep. All the water would readily pass, at the
ordinary velocity of the stream, in a channel <span class="measure"
title="6 meters">20 feet</span> wide and <span class="measure" title=
"2 meters">6 feet</span> deep.</p>
<p>Three methods are employed in fishing in this river&mdash;the first,
catching each fish in the hand; the second, driving the fish upstream
by fright into a receptacle; a third, a combined process of driving the
fish downstream by fright and by water pressure into a receptacle.</p>
<p>The Igorot seems not to have a general word for fish, but he has
names for the three varieties found in the river. One, ka-cho&prime;, a
very small, sluggish fish, is captured during the entire year. In
February these fish were seldom more than <span class="measure" title=
"5 centimeters">2 inches</span> in length, and yet they were heavy with
spawn. The ka-cho&prime; is the fish most commonly captured with the
hands. It is a sluggish swimmer and is provided with an exterior
suction valve on its ventral surface immediately back of the gill
opening. This valve seems to enable the fish to withstand the ordinary
current of the river which, in the rainy season, becomes a torrent.
This valve is also one of the causes of the Igorot&rsquo;s success
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4015" href="#xd21e4015" name=
"xd21e4015">86</a>]</span>in capturing the fish, which is not readily
frightened, but clings to the bed of the stream until almost brushed
away, and then ordinarily swims only <span class="measure" title=
"5 centimeters to a meter or so">a few inches or feet</span>. Small
boys from 6 to 10 years old capture by hand a hundred or more
ka-cho&prime; during half a day, simply by following them in the
shallow water.</p>
<p>The ka-cho&prime; is also caught in great numbers by the second or
driving method. Twenty to forty or more men fish together with a large,
closely woven, shovel-like trap called ko-y&ucirc;g&prime;, and the
operation is most interesting to witness. At the river beach the
fishermen remove all clothing, and stretch out on their faces in the
warm, sun-heated sand. Three men carry the trap to the middle of the
swift stream, and one holds it from floating away below him by grasping
the side poles which project at the upper end for that purpose. The two
other men, below the trap at its mouth, put large stones on their backs
between the shoulder blades, so they will not float downstream, and
disappear beneath the water. As quickly as possible, coming up a dozen
times to breathe during the process, they clear away the rocks below
the trap, piling them in it over its floor, until it finally sinks and
remains stationary on the cleared spot of sandy bed. Their task being
ended, the three trap setters come to shore, and sprawl on the hot
sands to warm their dripping skins, while the sun dries and toasts
their backs.</p>
<p>Then the drivers or beaters enter the river and stretch in a line
from shore to shore about <span class="measure" title="25 meters">75
feet</span> below the trap. Each fellow squats in the water and places
a heavy stone on his back. One of the men calls, and the row of
strange, hump-backed creatures disappears beneath the water. There the
men work swiftly, and, as later appears, successfully. Each turns over
all the bowlders within his reach as large or larger than his two
fists, and he works upstream <span class="measure" title=
"120 to 180 centimeters">4 to 6 feet</span>. They come up blowing, at
first a head here and there, but soon all are up with renewed breath,
waiting the next call to beat up the prey. This process is repeated
again and again, and each time the outer ends of the line bend
upstream, gradually looping in toward the trap. When the line of men
has become quite circular and is contracting rapidly, a dozen other men
enter the river from the shore and line up on each side of the mouth of
the trap, a flank movement to prevent the fish running upstream outside
the snare. From the circle of beaters a few now drop out; the others
are in a bunch, the last stone is turned, and the prey seeks covert
under the rocks in the trap, which the flankers at once lift above the
water. The rocks are thrown out and the trap and fish carried to the
shore.</p>
<p>In each drive they catch about <span class="measure" title=
"three liters">three quarts</span> of fish. These are dumped into
baskets, usually the carrying basket of the man, and when the
day&rsquo;s catch is made and divided each man receives an equal share,
usually about <span class="measure" title="half a kilogram">1
pound</span> per household. A procession of men and boys coming in from
the river, each carrying his share of fish in his basket <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4038" href="#xd21e4038" name=
"xd21e4038">87</a>]</span>hat in his <span class="corr" title=
"Source: hard">hand</span> and the last man carrying the fish trap, is
a sight very frequently seen in the pueblo.</p>
<p>The ka-cho&prime; is also caught in a small trap, called
ob-o&prime;-f&uuml;, by the third method mentioned above. A small strip
of shallow water along the shore is quite effectually cut off from the
remainder of the stream by a row of rocks. The lower end of this strip
is brought to a point where the water pours out and into the upturned
ob-o&prime;-f&uuml;, carrying with it the ka-cho&prime; which happen to
be in the swift current, the fish having been startled from their
secure resting places by the fishermen who have gradually proceeded
downstream overturning the stones.</p>
<p>A fish called &ldquo;li&prime;-l&#301;ng,&rdquo; which attains a
length of about <span class="measure" title="15 centimeters">6
inches</span>, is also caught by the last-described method. It is not
nearly so plentiful as the ka-cho&prime;.</p>
<p>One man living in Bontoc may be called a fisherman. He spends most
of his time with his traps in the river, and sells his fish to the
Ilokano and Igorot residents of the pueblo. He places large traps in
the deep parts of the stream, adjusts them, and revisits them by
swimming under the water, and altogether is considered by the Igorot
boys as quite a &ldquo;water man.&rdquo; He catches each year many
ka-cho&prime; and li&prime;-l&#301;ng, and one or more large fish,
called &ldquo;cha-l&#301;t.&rdquo; The cha-l&#301;t is said to acquire
a length of <span class="measure" title=
"90, 120, or 150 centimeters">3, 4, or 5 feet</span>.</p>
<p>Women and small children wade about the river and pick up quantities
of small crabs, called &ldquo;ag-ka&prime;-ma,&rdquo; and also a small
spiral shell, called &ldquo;ko&prime;-ti.&rdquo; It is safe to say that
every hour of a rainless day one or more persons of Bontoc is gathering
such food in the river. Immediately after the first rain of the season
of 1903, coming April 5, there were twenty-four persons, women and
small children, within <span class="measure" title="fifty meters">ten
rods</span> of one another, searching the river for ag-ka&prime;-ma and
ko&prime;-ti.</p>
<p>The women wear a small rump basket tied around the waist in which
they carry their lunch to the rice sementeras, and once or twice each
week they bring home from <span class="measure" title=
"about 50 to 500 grams">a few ounces to a pound</span> of small
crustaceans. One variety is named song&prime;-an, another is
kit-an&prime;, a third is f&#301;ng&prime;-a, and a fourth is
lis&prime;-ch&ucirc;g. They are all collected in the mud of the
sementeras.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main">Agriculture</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In all of Igorot culture the most apparent and
strikingly noteworthy fact is its agriculture. In agriculture the
Igorot has reached his highest development. On agriculture hangs his
claim to the rank of barbarian&mdash;without it he would be a
savage.</p>
<p>Igorot agriculture is unique in Luzon, and, so far as known,
throughout the Archipelago, in its mountain terraces and
irrigation.</p>
<p>There are three possible explanations of the origin of Philippine
rice terraces. First, that they (and those of other islands peopled by
primitive and modern Malayans, and those of Japan and China) are
indigenous&mdash;the product of the mountain lands of each isolated
area; second, that most of them are due to cultural influences from one
center, or possibly more than one center, to the north of
Luzon&mdash;as influences from China or Japan spreading southward from
island to island; third, that they, especially all those of the
Islands&mdash;excluding only China&mdash;are due to influences
originating south of the Philippines, spreading northward from island
to island.</p>
<p>Terracing may be indigenous to many isolated areas where it is
found, and doubtless is to some; it is found more or less marked
wherever irrigation is or was practiced in ancient or modern
agriculture. However, it is believed not to be an original production
of the Philippines. Certain it is that it is not a Negrito art, nor
does it belong to the Moro or to the so-called Christian people.</p>
<p>Different sections of China have rice terraces, and as early as the
thirteenth century Chinese merchants traded with the Philippines, yet
there is no record that they traded north of Manila&mdash;where
terracing is alone found. Besides, the Chinese record of the early
commerce with the Islands&mdash;written by Chao Jukua about 1250 it is
claimed&mdash;specifically states that the natives of the Islands were
the merchants, taking the goods from the shore and trading them even to
other islands; the Chinese did not pass inland. Even though the
Chinaman brought phases of his culture to the Islands, it would not
have been agriculture, since he did not practice it here. Moreover,
whatever culture he did leave would not be found in the mountains three
or four days inland, while the people with whom he traded were without
the art. The same arguments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4089"
href="#xd21e4089" name="xd21e4089">89</a>]</span>hold against the
Japanese as the inspirers of Igorot terraces. There is no record that
they traded in the Islands as early as did the Chinese, and it is safe
to say, no matter when they were along the coasts of Luzon, that they
never penetrated several days into the mountains, among a wild,
head-hunting people, for what the agricultural Igorot had to sell.</p>
<p>The historic cultural movements in Malaysia have been not from the
north southward but from Sumatra and Java to the north and east; they
have followed the migrations of the people. It is believed that the
terrace-building culture of the Asiatic islands for the production of
mountain rice by irrigation during the dry season has drawn its
inspiration from one source, and that such terraces where found to-day
in Java, Lombok, Luzon, Formosa, and Japan are a survival of very early
culture which spread from the nest of the primitive Malayan stock and
left its marks along the way&mdash;doubtless in other islands besides
these cited. If Japan, as has Formosa, had an early Malayan culture, as
will probably be proved in due time, one should not be surprised to
find old rice terraces in the mountains of Batanes Islands and the Loo
Choo Islands which lie between Luzon and Japan.</p>

<h6 class="main">Building the sementera</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It must be noted here that all Bontoc agricultural
labors, from the building of the sementera to the storing of the
gathered harvest, are accompanied by religious ceremonials. They are
often elaborate, and some occupy a week&rsquo;s time. These ceremonials
are left out of this chapter to avoid detail; they appear in <a href=
"#ch08">the later chapter on religion</a>.</p>
<p>There are two varieties of sementeras&mdash;garden patches, called
&ldquo;pay-yo&prime;&rdquo;&mdash;in the Bontoc area, the irrigated and
the unirrigated. The irrigated sementeras grow two crops annually, one
of rice by irrigation during the dry season and the other of camotes,
&ldquo;sweet potatoes,&rdquo; grown in the rainy season without
irrigation. The unirrigated sementera is of two kinds. One is the
mountain or side-hill plat of earth, in which camotes, millet, beans,
maize, etc., are planted, and the other is the horizontal plat
(probably once an irrigated sementera), usually built with low
terraces, sometimes lying in the pueblo among the houses, from which
shoots are taken for transplanting in the distant sementeras and where
camotes are grown for the pigs. Sometimes they are along old water
courses which no longer flow during the dry season; such are often
employed for rice during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The unirrigated mountain-side sementera, called
&ldquo;fo-ag&prime;,&rdquo; is built by simply clearing the trees and
brush from a mountain plat. No effort is made to level it and no dike
walls are built. Now and then one is hemmed in by a low boundary
wall.</p>
<p>The irrigated sementeras are built with much care and labor. The
earth is first cleared; the soil is carefully removed and placed in a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4107" href="#xd21e4107" name=
"xd21e4107">90</a>]</span>pile; the rocks are dug out; the ground
shaped, being excavated and filled until a level results. This task for
a man whose only tools are sticks is no slight one. A huge bowlder in
the ground means hours&mdash;often days&mdash;of patient, animal-like
digging and prying with hands and sticks before it is finally
dislodged. When the ground is leveled the soil is put back over the
plat, and very often is supplemented with other rich soil. These
irrigated sementeras are built along water courses or in such places as
can be reached by turning running water to them. Inasmuch as the water
must flow from one to another, there are practically no two sementeras
on the same level which are irrigated from the same water course. The
result is that every plat is upheld on its lower side, and usually on
one or both ends, by a terrace wall. Much of the mountain land is well
supplied with bowlders and there is an endless water-worn supply in the
beds of all streams. All terrace walls are built of these undressed
stones piled together without cement or earth. These walls are called
&ldquo;fa-n&#301;ng&prime;.&rdquo; They are from <span class="measure"
title="30 centimeters to 6 or 9 meters">1 to 20 and 30 feet</span> high
and from <span class="measure" title="30 to 45 centimeters">a foot to
18 inches</span> wide at the top. The upper surface of the top layer of
stones is quite flat and becomes the path among the sementeras. The
toiler ascends and descends among the terraces on stone steps made by
single rocks projecting from the outside of the wall at regular
intervals and at an angle easy of ascent and descent (see <a href=
"#pl053">Pl. LIII</a>).</p>
<p>These stone walls are usually weeded perfectly clean at least once
each year, generally at the time the sementera is prepared for
transplanting. This work falls to the women, who commonly perform it
entirely nude. At times a scanty front-and-back apron of leaves is worn
tucked under the girdle.</p>
<p>In the Banawi district, south of the Bontoc area, there are terrace
walls certainly <span class="measure" title="20 meters">75 feet</span>
in height, though many of these are not stoned, since the earth is of
such a nature that it does not readily crumble.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that nine-tenths of the available water supply of
the dry season in the Bontoc area is utilized for irrigation. In some
areas, as about Bontoc pueblo, there is practically not <span class=
"measure" title="a liter">a gallon</span> of unused water where there
is space for a sementera.</p>
<p>A single area consisting of <span class="measure" title=
"5 or more square kilometers">several thousand acres</span> of mountain
side is frequently devoted to sementeras, and I have yet to behold a
more beautiful view of cultivated land than such an area of Igorot rice
terraces. Winding in and out, following every projection, dipping into
every pocket of the mountain, the walls ramble along like running
things alive. Like giant stairways the terraces lead up and down the
mountain side, and, whether the levels are empty, dirt-colored areas,
fresh, green-carpeted stairs, or patches of ripening, yellow grain, the
beholder is struck with the beauty of the artificial landscape and
marvels at the industry of an otherwise savage people. <span class=

<h6 class="main">Irrigating</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By irrigation is meant the purposeful distribution of
water over soil by man by means of diverting streams or by the use of
canals in the shape of ditches or troughs for conveying and directing
part of a water supply, or by means of some other man-directed power to
raise water to the required level.</p>
<p>The Igorot employ three methods of irrigation: One, the simplest and
most natural, is to build sementeras along a small stream which is
turned into the upper sementera and passes from one to another, falling
from terrace to terrace until all water is absorbed, evaporated, or all
available or desired land is irrigated. Usually such streams are
diverted from their courses, and they are often carried long distances
out of their natural way. The second method is to divert a part of a
river by means of a stone dam. The third method is still more
artificial than the preceding&mdash;the water is lifted by direct human
power from below the sementera and poured to run over the surface.</p>
<p>The first method is the most common, since the mountains in Igorot
land are full of small, usually perpetual, streams. There are
practically no streams within reach of suitable pueblo sites which are
not exhausted by the Igorot agriculturist. Everywhere small streams are
carefully guarded and turned wherever there is <span class="measure"
title="a square meter">a square yard</span> of earth that may be made
into a rice sementera. Small streams in some cases have been wound for
<span class="measure" title="kilometers">miles</span> around the sides
of a mountain, passing deep gullies and rivers in wooden troughs or
tubes.</p>
<p>Much land along the river valleys is irrigated by means of dams,
called by the Igorot &ldquo;lung-ud&prime;.&rdquo; During the season of
1903 there was one dam (designated the main dam in <a href="#pl057">Pl.
LVII</a>&mdash;see also <a href="#pl055">Pls. LV</a> and <a href=
"#pl056">LVI</a>) across the entire river at Bontoc, throwing all the
water which did not leak through the stones into a large canal on the
Bontoc side of the valley. <span class="measure" title=
"800 meters">Half a mile</span> above this was another dam (called the
upper dam in <a href="#pl057">Pl. LVII</a>) diverting one-half the
stream to the same valley, only onto higher ground. Immediately below
the main dam were two low piles of stones (designated weirs) jutting
into the shallow stream from the Bontoc side, and each gathering
sufficient water for a few sementeras. Within <span class="measure"
title="400 meters">a quarter of a mile</span> below the main dam were
three other loose, open weirs of rocks, two of which began on a shallow
island, throwing water to the Samoki side of the river. In the stream a
short distance farther down a shallow row of rocks and gravel turned
water into three new sementeras constructed early in the year on a
gravel island in the river.</p>
<p>The main dam is about <span class="measure" title=
"3&frac12; meters">12 feet</span> high, <span class="measure" title=
"60 centimeters">2 feet</span> broad at the top, <span class="measure"
title="">8 or 10</span> at the bottom, and is about <span class=
"measure" title="90 meters">300 feet</span> long. It is built each year
during November and December, and requires the labor of fifteen or
twenty men <span class="corr" title="Not in source">for</span> about
six weeks. It is constructed of river-worn bowlders piled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4190" href="#xd21e4190" name=
"xd21e4190">92</a>]</span>together without adhesive. The top stones are
flat on the upper surface, and the dam is a pathway across the river
for the people from the time of its completion until its destruction by
the freshets of June or July.</p>
<p>The upper dam is a new piece of primitive engineering. It, with its
canal, has been in mind for at least two years; but it was completed
only in 1903. The dam is small, extending only half way across the
river, and beginning on an island. This dam turns water into a canal
averaging <span class="measure" title="a meter">3 feet</span> wide and
carrying about <span class="measure" title="15 centimeters">5
inches</span> of water. The canal, called &ldquo;a&prime;-lak,&rdquo;
is about <span class="measure" title="1,000 meters">3,000 feet</span>
long from the dam at <i>a</i> in <a href="#pl057">Pl. LVII</a> to the
place of discharge into the level area at <i>b</i>. For about
<span class="measure" title="160 meters">530 feet</span> of this
distance it was impossible for the primitive engineer to construct a
canal in the earth, as the solid rock of the mountain dips vertically
into the river. About fifty sections of large pine trees were brought
and hollowed into troughs, called &ldquo;ta-la&prime;-kan,&rdquo; which
have been secured above the water by means of buttresses, by wooden
scaffolding, called &ldquo;to-kod&prime;,&rdquo; and by attachment to
the overhanging rocks, until there is now a continuous artificial
waterway from the dam to the tract of irrigated land.</p>
<p>Considerable engineering sense has been shown and no small amount of
labor expended in the construction of this last irrigating scheme. The
pine logs are <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">a
foot</span> or more in diameter, and have a waterway dug in them about
<span class="measure" title="25 or 30 centimeters">10 or 12
inches</span> deep and wide. These trees were felled and the troughs
dug with the wasay, a short-handled tool with an iron blade only
<span class="measure" title="2&frac12; centimeters">an inch</span> or
<span class="measure" title="4 centimeters">an inch and a half</span>
wide, and convertible alike into ax and adz.</p>
<p>There seems to be a fall of about <span class="measure" title=
"6.70 meters">22 feet</span> between <i>a</i> at the upper dam and
<i>b</i> at the discharge from the troughs.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4241src" href="#xd21e4241" name="xd21e4241src">2</a> This fall in
a distance of about <span class="measure" title="900 meters">3,000
feet</span> seems needlessly great; however, the primitive engineer has
shown excellent judgment in the matter. First, by putting the dam
(upper dam) where it is, only half the stream had to be built across.
Second, there is a rapids immediately below the dam, and, had the
Igorot built his dam below the rapids, a dam of the same height would
have raised the water to a much lower level; this would have
necessitated a canal probably <span class="measure" title=
"3 or 3&frac12; meters">10 or 12 feet</span> deep instead <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4264" href="#xd21e4264" name=
"xd21e4264">93</a>]</span>of <span class="measure" title=
"one">three</span>. Third, the height of the water at the upper dam has
enabled him to lay the log section of the waterway above the high-water
mark of the river, thus, probably, insuring more or less permanence.
Had the dam been built much lower down the stream the troughs would
have been near the surface of the river and been torn away annually by
the freshets, or the people would be obliged each year to tear down and
reconstruct that part of the canal. As it now is it is probable that
only the short dam will need to be rebuilt each year.</p>
<p>All dams and irrigating canals are built directly by or at the
expense of the persons benefited by the water. Water is never rented to
persons with sementeras along an artificial waterway. If a person
refuses to bear his share of the labor of construction and maintenance
his sementeras must lie idle for lack of water.</p>
<p>All sementera owners along a waterway, whether it is natural or
artificial, meet and agree in regard to the division of the water. If
there is an abundance, all open and close their sluice gates when they
please. When there is not sufficient water for this, a division is
made&mdash;usually each person takes all the water during a certain
period of time. This scheme is supposed to be the best, since the flow
should be sufficient fully to flood the entire plat&mdash;a
<span class="measure" title="400-liter">100-gallon</span> flow in two
hours is considered much better than an equal flow in two days.</p>
<p>During the irrigating season, if there is lack of water, it becomes
necessary for each sementera owner to guard his water rights against
other persons on the same creek or canal. If a man sleeps in his house
during the period in which his sementeras are supposed to receive
water, it is pretty certain that his supply will be stolen, and, since
he was not on guard, he has no redress. But should sleep chance to
overtake him in his tiresome watch at the sementeras, and should some
one turn off and steal his water, the thief will get clubbed if caught,
and will forfeit his own share of water when his next period
arrives.</p>
<p>The third method of irrigation&mdash;lifting the water by direct
human power&mdash;is not much employed by the Igorot. In the vicinity
of Bontoc pueblo there are a few sementeras which were never in a
position to be irrigated by running water. They are called
&ldquo;pay-yo&prime; a kao-u&prime;-chan,&rdquo; and, when planted with
rice in the dry season, need to be constantly tended by toilers who
bring water to them in pots from the river, creeks, or canals. On the
Samoki side of the valley during a week or so of the driest weather in
May, 1903, there were four &ldquo;well sweeps,&rdquo; each with a
<span class="measure" title="20-liter">5-gallon</span> kerosene-oil can
attached, operating nearly all day, pouring water from a canal into
sementeras through <span class="measure" title="20 or 25 meter">60 or
80 feet</span> of small, wooden troughs.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Since rice, called &ldquo;pa-k&uuml;&prime;.&rdquo; is
the chief agricultural product of the Igorot it will be considered in
the following sections first, after which data of other vegetable
products will be given. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4292" href=
"#xd21e4292" name="xd21e4292">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Turning the soil for the annual crop of irrigated rice begins in the
middle of December and continues nearly two months. The labor of
turning and fertilizing the soil and transplanting the young rice is
all in progress at the same time&mdash;generally, too, in the same
sementera. Since each is a distinct process, however, I shall consider
each separately. Before the soil is turned in a sementera it has given
up its annual crop of camotes, and the water has been turned on to
soften the earth. From two to twenty adults gather in a sementera,
depending on the size of the plat, of which there are relatively few
containing more than <span class="measure" title=
"900 square meters">10,000 square feet</span>. They commonly range from
<span class="measure" title="3 square meters">30 square feet</span> to
<span class="measure" title="150 or 200">1,500 or 2,000</span>. The
following description is one of several made in detail while watching
the rice industry of the Bontoc Igorot.</p>
<p>The sementera is about <span class="measure" title=
"6 by 15 meters">20 by 50 feet</span>, or about <span class="measure"
title="90 square meters">1,000 square feet</span>, and lies in the
midst of the large valley area between Bontoc and Samoki. It is on the
Samoki side of the river, but is the property of a Bontoc family. There
are two groups of soil turners in the sementera&mdash;three men in one,
and two unmarried women, an older married woman, and a youth in the
other. At one end of the plat two, and part of the time three, women
are transplanting rice. Four men are bringing fertilizer for the soil.
Strange to say, each of the men in the group of three is
&ldquo;clothed&rdquo;&mdash;one wears his breechcloth as a breechcloth,
and the other two wear theirs simply as aprons, hanging loose in front.
Three of the men bringing fertilizer are entirely nude except for their
girdles, since they ford the river with their loads between the
sementera and Bontoc and do not care to wet their breechcloths; the
other man wears a bladder bag hanging from his girdle as an apron. One
of the young women turning the soil wears a skirt; the other one and
the old woman wear front-and-back aprons of camote vines; the youth
with them is nude. The three transplanters wear skirts, and one of them
wears an open jacket. Besides these there are three children in and
about the sementera; one is a pretty, laughing girl of about 9 years;
one is a shy, faded-haired little girl of 3 or 4 years; and the other
is a fat chunk of a boy about 5 years. All three are perfectly naked.
It is impossible to say what clothing these toilers wore before I went
among them to watch their work, but it is certain they were not more
clothed.</p>
<p>Let us watch the typical group of the three women and the youth:
Each has a sharpened wooden turning stick, the kay-kay, a pole about
<span class="measure" title="180 centimeters">6 feet</span> long and
<span class="measure" title="5 centimeters">2 inches</span> in
diameter. The four stand side by side with their kay-kay stuck in the
earth, and, in unison, they take one step forward and push their tools
from them, the earth under which the tools are thrust falling away and
crumbling in the water before them. While it is falling away the
toilers begin to sing, led by the elder woman. The purport of the most
common soil-turning song is this: &ldquo;It is hard work to turn the
soil, but eating the rice is good.&rdquo; The song <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4320" href="#xd21e4320" name=
"xd21e4320">95</a>]</span>continues while the implements are withdrawn
from the earth and jabbed in again in a new place, while the syllable
pronounced at that instant is also noticeably jabbed into the air.
Again they withdraw their implements and, singing and working in
rhythmic unison, again jab kay-kay and syllable. The implements are now
thrust about <span class="measure" title="20 centimeters">8
inches</span> below the surface; the song ceases; each toiler pries her
section of the soil loose and, in a moment, together they push their
tools from them, the mass of soil&mdash;some <span class="measure"
title="60 centimenters">2 feet</span> long, <span class="measure"
title="30 centimeters">1 foot</span> wide, and <span class="measure"
title="20 centimeters">8 inches</span> deep&mdash;falls away in the
water, and the song begins again. As the earth is turned a camote,
passed by in the camote harvest, is discovered; the old woman picks it
up and lays it on the dry ground beside her. The little girl shyly
comes for it and stores it in a basket on the terrace wall with a few
dozen others found during the morning.</p>
<p>After a section of earth <span class="measure" title=
"3 or 4&frac12; meters square">10 or 15 feet square</span> has been
turned the rhythmic labor and song ceases. Each person now grasps her
kay-kay with one hand at the middle and the other near the sharpened
end and with it rapidly crumbles and spreads about the new-turned soil.
Now they trample the bed thoroughly, throwing out any stones or pebbles
discovered by their feet, and frequently using the kay-kay further to
break up some small clod of earth. Finally a large section of the
sementera is prepared, and the toilers form in line abreast and slowly
tread back and forth over the plat, making the bed soft and smooth
beneath the water for the transplanting.</p>
<p>It is a delightful picture in the soil-turning season to see the
acres of terraces covered by groups of toilers, relieving their labors
with almost constant song.</p>
<p>I saw only one variation from the above methods in the Bontoc area.
In some of the large sementeras in the flat river bottom near Bontoc
pueblo a herd of seventeen carabaos was skillfully milled round and
round in the water, after the soil was turned, stirring and mixing the
bed into a uniform ooze. The animals were managed by a man who drove
them and turned them at will, using only his voice and a long switch.
It is impossible to get carabaos to many irrigated sementeras because
of the high terrace walls, but this herd is used annually in the Bontoc
river bottom.</p>
<p>After each rice harvest the soil of the irrigated sementera is
turned for planting camotes, but this time it is turned dry. More
effort is needed to thrust the kay-kay deep enough into the dry soil,
and it is thrust three or four times before the earth may be turned.
Only one-half the surface of a sementera is turned for camotes. Raised
beds are made about <span class="measure" title="60 centimeters">2
feet</span> wide and <span class="measure" title=
"20 to 30 centimeters">8 to 12 inches</span> high. The spaces between
these beds become paths along which the cultivator and harvester walks.
The soil is turned from the spaces used as paths over the spaces which
become beds, but the earth under the bed is not turned or loosened.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4352" href="#xd21e4352" name=
"xd21e4352">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bontoc beds are almost invariably constructed like parallel-sided,
square-cornered saw teeth standing at right angles to the blade of the
saw, which is also a camote bed, and are well shown in <a href=
"#pl062">Pl. LXII</a>. In Tulubin this saw-tooth bed also occurs, but
the continuous spiral bed and the broken, parallel, straight beds are
equally as common; they are shown in <a href="#fig02">figs. 2</a> and
<a href="#fig03">3</a>.</p>

<p>The mountain-side sementera for camotes, maize, millet, and beans is
prepared simply by being scratched or picked <span class="measure"
title="about ten centimeters">an inch or two</span> deep with the
woman&rsquo;s camote stick, the su-wan&prime;. If the plat is new the
grass is burned before the scratching occurs, but if it is cultivated
annually the surface seldom has any care save the shallow work of the
su-wan&prime;; in fact, the surface stones are seldom removed.</p>
<p>In the season of 1903, the first rains came April 5, and the first
mountain sementera was scratched over for millet April 10, after five
successive daily rains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4380" href=

<h6 class="main">Fertilizing</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Much care is taken in fertilizing the irrigated
sementeras. The hog of a few pueblos in the Bontoc area, as in Bontoc
and Samoki, is kept confined all its life in a walled, stone-paved sty
dug in the earth (see <a href="#pl077">Pl. LXXVII</a>). Into this
inclosure dry grasses and dead vines are continually placed to absorb
and become rotted by the liquids. As the soil of the sementera is
turned for the new rice crop these pigsties are cleaned out and the
rich manure spread on the beds.</p>
<p>The manure is sometimes carried by women though generally by men,
and the carriers in a string pass all day between the sementeras and
the pueblo, each bearing his transportation basket on his shoulder
containing about <span class="measure" title="45 kilograms">100
pounds</span> of as good fertilizer as agricultural man ever thought to
employ.</p>
<p>The manure is gathered from the sties with the two hands and is
dumped in the sementera in <span class="measure" title=
"5-kilogram">10-pound</span> piles about <span class="measure" title=
"150 centimeters">5 feet</span> apart after the soil has been turned
and trod soft and even.</p>
<p>It is said that in some sections of Igorot land dry vegetable matter
is burned so that ash may be had for fertilizing purposes.</p>
<p>I have seen women working long, dry grass under the soil in camote
sementeras at the time the crop was being gathered (<a href=
"#pl064">Pl. LXIV</a>), but I believe fertilizers are seldom employed,
except where rice is grown. Mountain-side sementeras are frequently
abandoned after a few years&rsquo; service, as they are supposed to be
exhausted, whereas fertilization would restore them.</p>

<h6 class="main">Seed planting</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Pad-cho-kan&prime; is the name of the sementera used
as a rice seed bed. One or more small groups of sementeras in every
pueblo is so protected from the cold rains and winds of November and
December and is so exposed to the warm sun that it answers well the
purposes of a primitive hotbed; consequently it becomes such, and
anyone who asks permission of the owner may plant his seed there (see
<a href="#pl065">Pl. LXV</a>).</p>
<p>The seed is planted in the beds after they have been thoroughly
worked and softened, the soil usually being turned three times. The
planting in Bontoc occurs the first part of November. November 15,
1902, the rice had burst its kernel and was above water in the Bontoc
beds. The seed is not shelled before planting, but the full fruit
heads, s&#301;n-lu&prime;-wi, are laid, without covering, on the soft
ooze, under <span class="measure" title="8 or 10 centimeters">3 or 4
inches</span> of water. They are laid in rows <span class="measure"
title="a few centimeters">a few inches</span> apart, and are so close
together that by the time the young plants are <span class="measure"
title="8 centimeters">3 inches</span> above the surface of the water
the bed is a solid mass of green.</p>
<p>Bontoc pueblo has six varieties of rice. Neighboring pueblos have
others; and it is probable that fifty, perhaps a hundred, varieties are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4431" href="#xd21e4431" name=
"xd21e4431">98</a>]</span>grown by the different irrigating peoples of
northern Luzon. In Bontoc, ti&prime;-pa is a white beardless variety.
Ga&prime;-sang is white, and cha-y&#277;t&prime;-&#301;t is claimed to
be the same grain, except it is dark colored; it is the rice from which
the fermented beverage, tapui, is made. Pu-i-a-pu&prime;-i and
tu&prime;-p&#277;ng are also white; tu&prime;-p&#277;ng is sowed in
unirrigated mountain sementeras in the rainy season.
Gu-m&#301;k&prime;-i is a dark grain.</p>
<p>Camotes, or to-ki&prime;, are planted once in a long period in the
sementeras surrounding the buildings in the pueblo. There is nothing to
kill them, the ground has no other use, so they are practically
perpetual.</p>
<p>The average size of all the eight varieties of Bontoc camotes is
about <span class="measure" title="5 by 10 centimeters">2 by 4
inches</span> in diameter. Six of the varieties are white and two are
red. The white ones are the following: Li-no&prime;-ko, <span class=
"corr" title="Source: pa-to&prime;ki">pa-to&prime;-ki</span>,
ki&prime;-n&ucirc;b fa-fay&prime;-i, pi-i-n&#301;t&prime;,
ki-w&#277;ng&prime;, and tang-tang-lab&prime;. The red ones are
si&prime;-s&#301;g and p&#301;t-ti&prime;-kan.</p>
<p>To illustrate the many varieties which may exist in a small area I
give the names of five other camotes grown in the pueblo of Balili,
which is only about four hours from Bontoc. The Balili white camotes
are bi-t&acirc;k&prime;-no, a-go-bang&prime;-bang, and la-ung&prime;-an
and the red are g&#301;s-g&#301;s&prime;-i and ta-mo&prime;-lo.</p>
<p>Millet, called &ldquo;sa&prime;-fug,&rdquo; is sowed on the surface
of the earth. The sowing is &ldquo;broadcast,&rdquo; but in a limited
way, as the fields are usually only <span class="measure" title=
"10 to 20 meters square">a few rods square</span>. The seed is
generally sowed by women, who carry a small basket or dish of it in one
hand and scatter the seed from between the thumb, forefinger, and
middle finger of the free hand.</p>
<p>There are said to be four varieties of millet in Bontoc.
Mo-di&prime; and poy-n&#277;d&prime; are light-colored seeds;
pi-t&#301;ng&prime;-an is a darker seed&mdash;the Igorot says
&ldquo;black;&rdquo; and si-nang&prime;-a is the fourth. I have never
seen it but I am told it is white.</p>
<p>Maize, or pi&prime;-ki, and beans, practically the only other seeds
planted, are planted annually in &ldquo;hills.&rdquo; The rows of
&ldquo;hills&rdquo; are quite irregular. Maize, as is also millet, is
planted immediately after the first abundant rains, occurring early in
April.</p>
<p>The Bontoc man has three varieties of beans. One is called
ka&prime;-lap; the kernel is small, being only <span class="measure"
title="five millimeters">one-fifth of an inch</span> long. Usually it
is pale green in color, though a few are black; both have an exterior
white germ. I&prime;-tab is about <span class="measure" title=
"eight millimeters">one-third of an inch</span> long. It is both gray
and black in color, and has a long exterior white germ. The third
variety is black with an exterior white germ. It is called
ba-la&prime;-tong, and is about <span class="measure" title=
"six millimeters">one-fourth of an inch</span> in length.</p>

<h6 class="main">Transplanting</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Transplanting is always the work of women, since they
are recognized as quicker and more dexterous in most work with the
hands than are the men. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4470" href=
"#xd21e4470" name="xd21e4470">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>The women pull up the young rice plants in the seed beds and tie
them in bunches about <span class="measure" title="10 centimeters">4
inches</span> in diameter. They transport them by basket to the newly
prepared sementera and dump them in the water so they will remain
fresh.</p>
<p>As has been said, the manure fertilizer is placed about the
sementera in piles. The women thoroughly spread this fertilizer with
their hands and feet when they transplant (see <a href="#pl059">Pl.
LIX</a>). When the soil is ready the transplanter grasps a handful of
the plants, twists off <span class="measure" title=
"8 or 10 centimeters">3 or 4 inches</span> of the blades, leaving the
plant about <span class="measure" title="15 centimeters">6
inches</span> long, and, while holding the plants in one hand, with the
other she rapidly thrusts them one by one into the soft bed. They are
placed in fairly regular rows, and are about <span class="measure"
title="13 centimeters">5 inches</span> apart. The planter leans
enthusiastically over her work, usually resting one elbow on her
knee&mdash;the left elbow, since most of the women are
right-handed&mdash;and she sets from forty to sixty plants per
minute.</p>
<p>When the sementeras are planted they present a clean and beautiful
appearance&mdash;even the tips of the rice blades twisted off are
invariably crowded into the muddy bed to assist in fattening the
crop.</p>
<p>As many as a dozen women often work together in one sementera to
hasten the planting. There are usually two or three little girls with
their mothers, who while away the hours playing work. They stuff up the
chinks of the stone walls with dirt and vegetable matter; they carry
together the few camotes discovered in this last handling of the old
camote bed; and they quite successfully and industriously play at
transplanting rice, though such small girls are not obliged to work in
the field.</p>
<p>Camotes are also transplanted. The women cut or pick off the
&ldquo;runners&rdquo; from the perpetual vines in the sementeras near
the dwellings. These they transplant in the unirrigated mountain
sementeras after the crops of millet and maize have been gathered.</p>
<p>The irrigated sementeras are also planted to camotes by
transplanting from these house beds. This transplanting lasts about six
weeks in Bontoc, beginning near the middle of July.</p>
<p>Some little sugar cane is grown by the Igorot of the Bontoc area. It
is claimed to grow up each year from the roots left at the preceding
harvest. At times new patches of cane are started by transplanting
shoots from the parent plants. It is said that in January the stalks
are cut and set in a rich mud, and that in the season of Baliling, from
about July 15 until early in September, the rooted shoots are
transplanted to the new beds.</p>

<h6 class="main">Cultivating</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The chief cultivation given to Igorot crops is
bestowed on rice, though all cultivated lands are remarkably free from
weeds. The rice sementeras are carefully weeded, &ldquo;suckers&rdquo;
are pulled out, and the beds are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4505" href="#xd21e4505" name="xd21e4505">100</a>]</span>thinned
generally, so that each plant will have all needful chance to develop
fruit. This weeding and thinning is the work of women and half-grown
children. Every day for nearly two months, or until the fruit heads
appear, the cultivators are diligently at work in the sementeras. No
tools or agricultural implements other than bare hands are used in this
work.</p>
<p>The men keep constant watch of the sementera walls and the
irrigating canals, repairing all, thus indirectly assisting the women
in their cultivation by directing water to the growing crop and by
conserving it when it is obtained.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div5 subsection" id="xd21e4509">
<div class="divHead">
<h6 class="main">Protecting</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rice begins to fruit early in April, at which time
systematic effort to protect the new grain from birds, rats, monkeys,
and wild hogs commences. This effort continues until the harvest is
completed, practically for three months. Much of this labor is
performed by water power, much by wind power, and about all the
children and old people in a pueblo are busied from early dawn until
twilight in the sementera as independent guards. Besides, throughout
the long night men and women build fires among the sementeras and guard
their crop from the wild hog. It is a critical time with the
Igorot.</p>
<p>The most natural, simplest, and undoubtedly the most successful
protection of the grain is the presence of a person on the terrace
walls of the sementera, whether by day or night. Hundreds of fields are
so guarded each day in Bontoc by old people and children, who
frequently erect small screens of tall grass to shade and protect
themselves from the sun.</p>
<p>The next simplest method is one followed by the boys. They employ a
hollow section of carabao horn, cut off at both ends and about
<span class="measure" title="20 centimeters">8 inches</span> in length;
it is called &ldquo;kong-ok&prime;.&rdquo; This the boys beat when
birds are near, producing an open, resonant sound which may readily be
heard <span class="measure" title="a kilometer">a mile</span>.</p>
<p>The wind tosses about over the growing grain various
&ldquo;scarecrows.&rdquo; The pa-ch&#277;k&prime; is one of these. It
consists of a single large dry leaf, or a bunch of small dry leaves,
suspended by a cord from a heavy, coarse grass <span class="measure"
title="180 or 240 centimeters">6 or 8 feet</span> high; the leaf, the
sa-gi-kak&prime;, hangs <span class="measure" title="120 centimeters">4
feet</span> above the fruit heads. It swings about slightly in the
breeze, and probably is some protection against the birds. I believe it
the least effective of the various things devised by the Igorot to
protect his rice from the multitudes of ti-l&#301;n&prime;&mdash;the
small, brown ricebird<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4532src" href=
"#xd21e4532" name="xd21e4532src">3</a> found broadly over the
Archipelago.</p>
<p>The most picturesque of these wind-tossed bird scarers is the
ki&prime;-lao. The ki&prime;-lao is a basket-work figure swung from a
pole and is usually the shape and size of the distended wings of a
large gull, though it is also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4539"
href="#xd21e4539" name="xd21e4539">101</a>]</span>made in other shapes,
as that of man, the lizard, etc. The pole is about <span class=
"measure" title="6 meters">20 feet</span> high, and is stuck in the
earth at such an angle that the swinging figure attached by a line at
the top of the pole hangs well over the sementera and about
<span class="measure" title="90 to 120 centimeters">3 or 4 feet</span>
above the grain (see <a href="#pl067">Pl. LXVII</a>). The bird-like
ki&prime;-lao is hung by its middle, at what would be the neck of the
bird, and it soars back and forth, up and down, in a remarkably
lifelike way. There are often a dozen ki&prime;-lao in a space
<span class="measure" title="20 meters">4 rods square</span>, and they
are certainly effectual, if they look as bird-like to
ti-l&#301;n&prime; as they do to man. When seen a short distance away
they appear exactly like a flock of restless gulls turning and dipping
in some harbor.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4554width"><img src="images/fig04.jpg" alt=
"Bird scarer in rice field." width="226" height="336">
<p class="figureHead">Bird scarer in rice field.</p>
</div>
<p>The water-power bird scarers are ingenious. Across a shallow,
running rapids in the river or canal a line, called
&ldquo;pi-chug&prime;,&rdquo; is stretched, fastened at one end to a
yielding pole, and at the other to a rigid pole. A bowed piece of wood
about <span class="measure" title="40 centimeters">15 inches</span>
long and <span class="measure" title="8 centimeters">3 inches</span>
wide, called &ldquo;pit-ug&prime;,&rdquo; is suspended by a line at
each end from the horizontal cord. This pit-ug&prime; is suspended in
the rapids, by which it is carried quickly downstream as far as the
elasticity of the yielding pole and the pi-chug&prime; will allow, then
it snaps suddenly back upstream and is ready to be carried down and
repeat the jerk on the relaxing pole. A system of cords passes high in
the air from the jerking pole at the stream to other slender, jerked
poles among the sementeras. From these poles a low jerking line runs
over the sementeras, over which are stretched at right <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4566" href="#xd21e4566" name=
"xd21e4566">102</a>]</span>angles parallel cords within <span class=
"measure" title="a meter or two">a few feet</span> of the fruit heads.
These parallel cords are also jerked, and their movement, together with
that of the leaves depending from them, is sufficient to keep the birds
away. One such machine may send its shock <span class="measure" title=
"400 meters">a quarter of a mile</span> and trouble the birds over an
area <span class="measure" title="2,000 square meters">half an
acre</span> in extent.</p>
<p>Other Igorot, as those of the upper Abra River in Lepanto Province,
employ this same jerking machine to produce a sharp, clicking sound in
the sementera. The jerking cord repeatedly raises a series of hanging,
vertical wooden fingers, which, on being released, fall against a
stationary, horizontal bamboo tube, producing the sharp click. These
clicking machines are set up on two supporting sticks <span class=
"measure" title="a meter or two">a few feet</span> above the grain
every <span class="measure" title="three or four meters">three or four
yards</span> about the sementeras.</p>
<p>There are many rodents, rats and mice, which destroy the growing
grain during the night unless great care is taken to cheek them. The
Igorot makes a small dead fall which he places in the path surrounding
the sementera. I have seen as many as five of these traps on a single
side of a sementera not more than <span class="measure" title=
"10 meters">30 feet</span> square. The trap has a closely woven, wooden
dead fall, about <span class="measure" title="25 or 40 centimeters">10
or 15 inches</span> square; one end is set on the path and the other is
supported in the air above it by a string. One end of this string is
fastened to a tall stick planted in the earth, the lower end is tied to
a short stick&mdash;a part of the &ldquo;spring&rdquo; held rigid
beneath the dead fall until the trigger is touched. The dead fall drops
when the rat, in touching the trigger, releases the lower end of the
cord. The animal springs the trigger either by nibbling a bait on it or
by running against it, and is immediately killed, since the dead fall
is weighted with stones.</p>
<p>Sementeras near some forested mountains in the Bontoc area are
pestered with monkeys. Day and night people remain on guard against
them in lonely, dangerous places&mdash;just the kind of spot the
head-hunter chooses wherein to surprise his enemy.</p>
<p>All border sementeras in every group of fields are subject to the
night visits of wild hogs. In some areas commanding piles of earth for
outlooks are left standing when the sementeras are constructed. In
other places outlooks are erected for the purpose. Permanent shelters,
some of them commodious stone structures, are often erected on these
outlooks where a person remains on guard night and day (<a href=
"#pl068">Pl. LXVIII</a>), at night burning a fire to frighten the wild
hogs away.</p>
<p>At this season of the year when practically all the people of the
pueblo are in the sementeras, it is most interesting to watch the
homecoming of the laborers at night. At early dusk they may be seen
coming in over the trails leading from the sementeras to the pueblo in
long processions. The boys and girls 5 or 6 years old or more, most of
them entirely naked, come playing or dancing along&mdash;the boys often
marking time by beating a tin can or two sticks&mdash;seemingly as full
of life as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p103" href="#p103" name=
"p103">103</a>]</span>when they started out in the morning. The younger
children are toddling by the side of their father or mother, a small,
dirty hand smothered in a large, labor-cracked one; or else are carried
on their father&rsquo;s back or shoulder, or perhaps astride their
mother&rsquo;s hip. The old men and women, almost always unsightly and
ugly, who go to the sementera only to guard and not to toil, come
slowly and feebly home, often picking their way with a staff. There is
much laughing and coquetting among the young people. A boy dashes by
with several girls in laughing pursuit, and it is not at all likely
that he escapes them with all his belongings. Many of the younger
married women carry babies; some carry on their heads baskets filled
with weeds used as food for the pigs, and all have their small rump
baskets filled with &ldquo;greens&rdquo; or snails or fish.</p>
<p>A man may carry on his shoulder a huge short log of wood cut in the
mountains, the wood partially supported on the shoulder by his spear;
or he perhaps carries a large bunch of dry grass to be thrown into the
pigpen as bedding; or he comes swinging along empty handed save for his
spear used as a staff. Most of the returning men and boys carry the
empty topil, the small, square, covered basket in which rice for the
noon meal is carried to the sementera; sometimes a boy carries a bunch
of three or four, and he dangles them open from their strings as he
dances along.</p>
<p>For an hour or more the procession continues&mdash;one almost-naked
figure following another&mdash;all dirty, most of them doubtless tired,
and yet seemingly happy and content with the finish of their day of
toil. It is long after dark before the last straggler is in.</p>

<h6 class="main">Harvesting</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Rice harvesting in Bontoc is a delightful and
picturesque sight to an American, and a most serious religious matter
to the Igorot.</p>
<p>Though ceremonials having to do with agriculture have purposely been
omitted from this chapter, yet, since one of the most striking and
important features of the harvesting is the harvest ceremonial, it is
thought best to introduce it here.</p>
<p>Sa-fo&prime;-sab is the name of the ceremony. It is performed in a
pathway adjoining each sementera before a single grain is gathered. In
the path the owner of the field builds a tiny fire beside which he
stands while the harvesters sit in silence. The owner says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="bo">So-mi-ka-ka&prime; pa-k&uuml;&prime; ta-mo
i-sa&prime;-mi s&#301;k&prime;-a k&#301;n-po-num&prime; nan
a-lang&prime;</span>,&rdquo; which, freely rendered, means,
&ldquo;Palay, when we carry you to the granary, increase greatly so
that you will fill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the ceremonial is said the speaker harvests one handful
of the grain, after which the laborers arise and begin the harvest.</p>
<p>In the trails leading past the sementera two tall stalks of runo are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4628" href="#xd21e4628" name=
"xd21e4628">104</a>]</span>planted, and these, called
&ldquo;pud-i-pud&prime;,&rdquo; warn all Igorot that they must not pass
the sementera during the hours of the harvest. Nor will they ignore the
warning, since if they do they are liable to forfeit a hog or other
valuable possession to the owner of the grain.</p>
<p>I spent half a day trying to get close enough to a harvesting party
to photograph it. All the harvesters were women, and they scolded our
party long and severely while we were yet <span class="measure" title=
"30 or 40 meters">six or eight rods</span> distant; my Igorot boys
carrying the photographic outfit&mdash;boys who had lived four months
in my house&mdash;laughingly but positively refused to follow me closer
than <span class="measure" title="15 or 20 meters">three or four
rods</span> to the sementera. No photographs were obtained at that
time. It was only after the matter was talked over by some of the men
of the pueblo that photographs could be willingly obtained, and the
force of the warning pud-i-pud&prime; withdrawn for our party. Even
during the time my Igorot boys were in the trail by a harvest party all
other Igorot passed around the warning runo. The Igorot says he
believes the harvest will be blasted even while being gathered should
one pass along a pathway skirting any side of the sementera.</p>
<p>Several harvesters, from four to a dozen, labor together in each
sementera. They begin at one side and pass across the plat, gathering
all grain as they pass. Men and women work together, but women are
recognized the better harvesters, since their hands are more nimble.
Each fruited stalk is grasped shortly below the fruit head, and the
upper section or joint of the stalk, together with the fruit head and
topmost leaf, is pulled off. As most Bontoc Igorot are right-handed,
the plucked grain is laid in the left hand, the fruit heads projecting
beyond between the thumb and forefinger while the leaf attached to each
fruit head lies outside and below the thumb. When the proper amount of
grain is in hand (a bunch of stalks about <span class="measure" title=
"25 millimeters">an inch</span> in diameter) the useless leaves, all
arranged for one grasp of the right hand, are stripped off and dropped;
the bunch of fruit heads, topping <span class="measure" title=
"15-centimeter">a 6-inch</span> section of clean stalk or straw is
handed to a person who may be called the binder. This person in all
harvests I have seen was a woman. She binds all the grain three, four,
or five persons can pluck; and when there is one binder for every three
gatherers the binder finds some time also to gather.</p>
<p>The binder passes a small, prepared strip of bamboo twice around the
palay stalks, holds one end between her teeth and draws the binding
tight; then she twists the two ends together, and the bunch is secure.
The bunch, the manojo of the Spaniard, the s&#301;n f&#301;ng-e&prime;
of the Igorot, is then piled up on the binder&rsquo;s head until a load
is made. Before each bunch is placed on the pile the fruitheads are
spread out like an open fan. These piles are never completed until they
are higher than the woman&rsquo;s arm can reach&mdash;several of the
last bunches being tossed in place, guided only by the tips of the
fingers touching the butt of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4648" href="#xd21e4648" name="xd21e4648">105</a>]</span>straw.
The women with their heads loaded high with ripened grain are striking
figures&mdash;and one wonders at the security of the loads.</p>
<p>When a load is made it is borne to the transportation baskets in
some part of the harvested section of the sementera, where it is gently
slid to the earth over the front of the head as the woman stoops
forward. It is loaded into the basket at once unless there is a
scarcity of binders in the field, in which case it awaits the
completion of the harvest.</p>
<p>In all agricultural labors the Igorot is industrious, yet his humor,
ever present with him, brings relief from continued toil. The harvest
field is no exception, since there is much quiet gossip and jest during
the labors.</p>
<p>In 1903 rice was first harvested May 2. The harvest continued one
month, the crop of a sementera being gathered here and there as it
ripened. The Igorot calls this first harvest month the &ldquo;moon of
the small harvest.&rdquo; During June the crop is ripened everywhere,
and the harvest is on in earnest; the Igorot speaks of it as the
&ldquo;moon of the all harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no view of the harvest of millet or maize; however, I have
seen in the pueblo much of each grain of some previous harvest. The
millet I am told, is harvested similarly to the rice, and the
clean-stalked bunches are tied up in the same way&mdash;only the
bunches are four or five times larger.</p>
<p>The fruit head, or ears, of the maize is said to be plucked off the
stalks in the fields as the American farmer gathers green corn or seed
corn. It is stored still covered with its husks.</p>
<p>The camote harvest is continued fairly well throughout the year.
Undoubtedly some camotes are dug every day in the year from the dry
mountain-side sementeras, but the regular harvest occurs during
November and December, during which time the camotes are gathered from
the irrigated sementeras preparatory to turning the soil for the
transplanting of new rice.</p>
<p>Women are the camote gatherers. I never saw men, nor even boys,
gathering camotes. At no other time does the Igorot woman look so
animal like as when she toils among the camote vines, standing with
legs straight and feet spread, her body held horizontal, one hand
grasping the middle of her short camote stick and the other in the soil
picking out the unearthed camotes. She looks as though she never had
stood erect and never would stand erect on two feet. Thus she toils day
after day from early morning till dusk that she and her family may
eat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div5 subsection" id="xd21e4665">
<div class="divHead">
<h6 class="main">Storing</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No palay is carried to the a-lang&prime;, the separate
granary building, or to the dwelling for the purpose of being stored
until the entire crop of the sementera is harvested. It may be carried
part way, but there it halts until all the grain is ready to be carried
home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4670" href="#xd21e4670" name=
"xd21e4670">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is spread out on the ground or on a roof in the sun two or three
days to dry before storing. When the grain is to be stored away an old
man&mdash;any man&mdash;asks a blessing on it that it may make men,
hogs, and chickens well, strong, and fat when they consume it. This
ceremony is called &ldquo;ka-fo&prime;-kab,&rdquo; and the man who
performs it is known by the title of &ldquo;in-ka-fa&prime;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Igorot granary, the a-lang&prime;, is a &ldquo;hip-roofed&rdquo;
structure about <span class="measure" title="240 centimeters">8
feet</span> long, <span class="measure" title=
"150 centimeters">5</span> wide, <span class="measure" title=
"120 centimeters">4 feet</span> high at the sides and <span class=
"measure" title="180 centimeters">6</span> at the ridgepole. Its sides
are built of heavy pine planks, which are inserted in grooved
horizontal timbers, the planks being set up vertically. The floor is
about <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">a foot</span> from
the earth. The roof consists of a heavy, thick cover of long grass
securely tied on a pole frame. It is seldom that a granary stands
alone&mdash;usually there are two or more together, and Bontoc has
several groups of a dozen each, as shown in <a href="#pl072">Pl.
LXXII</a>. When built together they are better protected from the rain
storms. The roofs also are made so they extend close to the earth, thus
almost entirely protecting the sides of the structure from the storms.
All cracks are carefully filled with pieces of wood wedged and driven
in. Even the door, consisting of two or three vertical planks set in
grooved timbers, is laboriously wedged the same way. The building is
rodent proof, and, because of its wide, projecting roof and the fact
that it sets off the earth, it is practically moisture proof.</p>
<p>Most palay is stored in the granaries in the small bunches tied at
harvest. The a-lang&prime; is carefully closed again after each
sementera crop has been put in. There are granaries in Bontoc which
have not been opened, it is said, in eight or more years, except to
receive additional crops of palay, and yet the grain is as perfectly
preserved as when first stored. Some palay, especially that needed for
consumption within a reasonable time, is stored in the upper part of
the family dwelling.</p>
<p>Maize and millet are generally stored in the dwelling, in the second
and third stories, since not enough of either is grown to fill an
a-lang&prime;, it is said.</p>
<p>Camotes are sometimes stored in the granary after the harvest of the
irrigated fields. Often they are put away in the kubkub, the two
compartments at either end of the sleeping room on the ground floor of
the dwelling. At other times one sees bushels of camotes put away on
the earth under the broad bench extending the full length of the
dwelling. In the poorer class of dwellings the camotes are frequently
dumped in a corner.</p>
<p>Beans are dried and shelled before storing and are set away in a
covered basket, usually in the upper part of the dwelling. Only one or
two cargoes are grown by each family, so little space is needed for
storage.</p>
<p>Since rice is the staple food and may be preserved almost
indefinitely, the Igorot has developed a means and place to care for
it. Maize and millet, while probably capable of as long preservation,
are generally not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4704" href=
"#xd21e4704" name="xd21e4704">107</a>]</span>grown in sufficient
quantity to require more storage space than the upper part of the
dwelling affords. The Igorot has not developed a way to preserve his
camotes long after harvest; they are readily perishable, consequently
no place has been differentiated as a storehouse.</p>

average annual crop of ten cargoes of palay, each worth 1 peso. Thus
there is an annual gross profit of ten per cent on the value of the
permanent investment.</p>
<p>It requires ten men one day to turn the soil and fertilize the plat.
The wage paid in palay is equivalent to 5 cents per laborer, or 50
cents. Five women can transplant the rice in one day; cost, 25 cents.
Cultivating and protecting the crop falls to the members of the family
which owns the sementera, so the Igorot say; he claims never to have to
pay for such labor. Twenty people can harvest the crop in a day; cost,
1 peso.</p>
<p>The total annual expense of maintaining the sementera as a
productive property is, therefore, equivalent to 1.75 pesos. This
leaves 8.25 pesos net profit when the annual expense is deducted from
the annual gross profit. A net profit of 8.25 per cent is about
equivalent to the profit made on the <span class="measure" title=

<p class="first">The carabao, hog, chicken, and dog are the only
animals domesticated by the Igorot of the Bontoc culture area.</p>
<p>Cattle are kept by Benguet Igorot throughout the extent of the
province. Some towns, as Kabayan, have 300 or 400 head, but the Bontoc
Igorot has not yet become a cattle raiser.</p>
<p>In Benguet, Lepanto, and Abra there are pueblos with half a hundred
brood mares. Daklan, of Benguet, has such a bunch, and other pueblos
have smaller herds.</p>
<p>In Bontoc Province between Bontoc pueblo and Lepanto Province a few
mares have recently been brought in. Sagada and Titipan each have half
a dozen. Near the east side of the Bontoc area there are a few bunches
of horses reported among the Igorot, and in February, 1903, an American
brought sixteen head from there into Bontoc. These horses are all
descendants of previous domestic animals, and an addition of half a
hundred is said to have been made to the number by horses abandoned by
the insurgents about three years past. Some of the sixteen brought out
in 1903 bore saddle marks and the brands common in the coastwise lands.
These eastern horses are not used by the Igorot except <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4738" href="#xd21e4738" name=
"xd21e4738">108</a>]</span>for food, and no property right is
recognized in them, though the Igorot brands them with a battle-ax
brand. He exercises about as much protecting control over them as the
Bontoc man does over the wild carabao.</p>

<h6 class="main">Carabao</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The people of Bontoc say that when Lumawig came to
Bontoc they had no domestic carabaos&mdash;that those they now have
were originally purchased, before the Spaniards came, from the Tinguian
of Abra Province.</p>
<p>There are in the neighborhood of 400 domestic carabaos owned in
Bontoc and Samoki. Most of them run half wild in the mountains
encircling the pueblos. Such as are in the mountains receive neither
herding, attention in breeding, feed, nor salt from their owners. The
young are dropped in February and March, and their owners mark them by
slitting the ear, each person recognizing his own by the mark.</p>
<p>A herd of seventeen, consisting of animals belonging to five owners,
ranges in the river bottom and among the sementeras close to Bontoc.
These animals are more tame than those of the mountains, but receive
little more attention, except that they are taught to perform a certain
unique labor in preparing the sementeras for rice, as has been noted in
the section on agriculture. This is the only use to which the Bontoc
carabao is put as a power in industry. He is seldom sold outside the
pueblo and is raised for consumption, chiefly on various ceremonial
occasions.</p>
<p>Four men in Bontoc own fifty carabaos each. Three others have a herd
of thirty in joint ownership. Others own five and six each, and again a
single carabao may be the joint property of two and even six
individuals. Carabaos are valued at from 40 to 70 pesos.</p>

<h6 class="main">Hog</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bontoc has no record of the time or manner of first
acquiring the hog, chicken, or dog. The people say they had all three
when Lumawig came.</p>
<p>Sixty or 70 per cent of the pigs littered in Bontoc are marked
lengthwise with alternate stripes of brick-red or yellowish hair, the
other hair being black or white; the young of the wild hog is marked
the same. All the pigs, both domestic and wild, outgrow this red or
yellow marking at about the age of six months, and when they are a year
old become fine-looking black hogs with white marking not unlike the
Berkshire of the States. There is no chance to doubt that the Igorot
domestic hog was the wild hog in the surrounding mountains a few
generations ago.</p>
<p>The Bontoc hog is bred, born, and raised in a secure pen, yet wild
blood is infused direct, since pigs are frequently purchased by Bontoc
from surrounding pueblos, most of whose hogs run half wild and
intermingle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4760" href="#xd21e4760"
name="xd21e4760">109</a>]</span>with the wild ones of the mountains.
That the domestic hog in some places in northern Luzon does thus
interbreed with the wild ones is a proved fact. In the Quiangan area I
was shown a litter of half-breeds and was told that it was customary
for the pueblo sows to breed to the wild boar of the mountains.</p>
<p>The Bontoc hog in many ways is a pampered pet. He is at all times
kept in a pen and fed regularly three times each day with camote vines
when in season, with camote parings, and small camotes available, and
with green vegetal matter, including pusleys, gathered by the girls and
women when there are no camote vines. All of his food is carefully
washed and cooked before it is given to him.</p>
<p>The pigsty consists of a pit in the earth about <span class=
"measure" title="120 centimeters">4 feet</span> deep, <span class=
"measure" title="150 or 180 centimeters">5 or 6 feet</span> wide, and
<span class="measure" title="240 or 360 centimeters">8 or 12
feet</span> long. It is entirely lined with bowlders, and the floor
space consists of three sections of about equal size. One end is
<span class="measure" title="half a meter or more">two or more
feet</span> deeper than the other, and it is into this lower space that
the washings of the pen are stored in the rotted straw and weeds, and
from which the manure for fertilizer is taken. The other end is covered
over level with the outside earth with timbers, stones, and dirt; it is
the pig&rsquo;s bed and is entered by a doorway in the stone wall. Most
of these &ldquo;beds&rdquo; have a low, grass roof about <span class=
"measure" title="75 centimeters">30 inches</span> high over them.
Underneath the roof is an opening in the earth where the people
defecate. Connecting the &ldquo;bed&rdquo; section and the opposite
lower section of the sty is an incline on which the stone
&ldquo;feed&rdquo; troughs are located.</p>
<p>As soon as a pig is weaned he is kept in a separate pen, and one
family may have in its charge three or four pens. The sows are kept
mainly for breeding, and there are many several years old. The richest
man in Bontoc owns about thirty hogs, and these are farmed out for
feeding and breeding&mdash;a common practice. When one is killed it is
divided equally between the owner and the feeder. When a litter of pigs
is produced the bunch is divided equally, the sow remaining the
property of the owner and counting as one in the division. Throughout
the Island of Luzon it is the practice to leave most male animals
uncastrated. But in Bontoc the boar not intended for breeding is
castrated.</p>
<p>Hogs are raised for ceremonial consumption. They are commonly bought
and sold within the pueblo, and are not infrequently sold outside. A
pig weighing <span class="measure" title="4&frac12; kilograms">10
pounds</span> is worth about 3 pesos, and a hog weighing <span class=
"measure" title="25 or 30 kilograms">60 or 70 pounds</span> is valued
at about 12 pesos.</p>

<h6 class="main">Chicken</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc domestic chickens were originally the wild
fowl, found in all places in the Archipelago, although some of them
have acquired varied colorings and markings, largely, probably, from
black and white Spanish fowl, which are still found among them. The
markings of the wild fowl, however, are the most common, and
practically all small chickens are marked as are their wild kin. The
wild fowl bears markings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4799" href=
"#xd21e4799" name="xd21e4799">110</a>]</span>similar to those of the
American black-breasted red game, though the fowls are smaller than the
American game fowl. Each of the twelve wild cocks I have had in my
hands had perfect five-pointed single combs, and the domestic cock of
Bontoc also commonly has this perfect comb. I know of no people within
the Bontoc area who now systematically domesticate the wild fowl,
though this was found to be the custom of the Ibilao southeast of Dupax
in the Province of Nueva Vizcaya. Those people catch the young wild
fowl for domestication.</p>
<p>The Bontoc domestic fowl are not confined in a coop except at night,
when they sleep in small cages placed on the ground in the dwelling
houses. In the daytime they range about the pueblo feeding much in the
pigpens, though they are fed a small amount of raw rice each morning.
Their nests are in baskets secured under the eaves of the dwelling, and
in those baskets the brooding hens hatch their chicks, from eight to
twenty eggs being given a hen. The fowl is raised exclusively for
ceremonial consumption, and is frequently sold in the pueblo for that
purpose, being valued at from half a peso to a peso each. A wild fowl
sells for half a peso.</p>
<p>In Banawi of the Quiangan area, south of Bontoc, one may find large
capons, but Bontoc does not understand caponizing.</p>

<h6 class="main">Dog</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dog of the Bontoc Igorot is usually of a solid
color, black, white, or yellow, really &ldquo;buckskin&rdquo; color.
Where he originated is not known. He has none of the marks of the
Asiatic dog which has left its impress everywhere in the lowlands of
the west coast of Luzon&mdash;called in the Islands the
&ldquo;Chino&rdquo; dog, and in the States the &ldquo;Eskimo&rdquo;
dog. The Igorot dog is short-haired, sharp-eared, gaunt, and sinewy,
with long legs and body. In height and length he ranges from a
fair-sized fox terrier to a collie. I fail to see anything in him
resembling the Australian dingo or the &ldquo;yellow cur&rdquo; of the
States. The Ibilao have the same dog in two colors, the black and the
&ldquo;brindle&rdquo;&mdash;the brown and black striped. In fact, a dog
of the same general characteristics occurs throughout northern Luzon.
No matter what may be his origin, a dog so widely diffused and so
characteristically molded and marked must have been on the island long
enough to have acquired its typical features here. The dog receives
little attention from his owners. Twice each day he is fed sparingly
with cooked rice or camotes. Except in the case of the few hunting
dogs, he does nothing to justify his existence. He lies about the
dwelling most of the time, and is a surly, more or less evil-tempered
cur to strangers, though when a pueblo flees to the mountains from its
attacking enemies the dog escapes in a spiritless way with the women
and children. He is bred mainly for ceremonial consumption.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4810" href="#xd21e4810" name=
"xd21e4810">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Benguet the Igorot eats his dog only after it has been reduced to
skin and bones. I saw two in a house so poor that they did not raise
their heads when I entered, and the man of the house said they would be
kept twenty days longer before they would be reduced properly for
eating. No such custom exists in Bontoc, but dogs are seldom fat when
eaten. They are not often bought or sold outside the pueblo. A litter
of pups is generally distributed about the town, and dogs are
constantly bought and sold within the pueblo for ceremonial purposes.
They are valued at from 2 to 4 pesos.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Up to the age of 6 or 7 years the Igorot boys are as
naked as when born. At that time they put on the suk&prime;-l&acirc;ng,
the basket-work hat worn on the back of the head, held in place by a
cord attached at both sides and passing across the forehead and usually
hidden by the front hair. The suk&prime;-l&acirc;ng is made in nearly
all pueblos in the Bontoc culture area. It does not extend
uninterruptedly to the western border, however, since it is not worn at
all in Agawa, and in some other pueblos near the Lepanto border, as
Fidelisan and Genugan, it has a rival in the headband. The beaten-bark
headband, called &ldquo;a-pong&prime;-ot,&rdquo; and the headband of
cloth are worn by short-haired men, while the long-haired man
invariably wears the hat. The suk&prime;-l&acirc;ng varies in shape
from the fez-like ti-no-od&prime; of Bontoc and Samoki, through various
hemispherical forms, to the low, flat hats developing eastward and
perfected in the last mountains west of the Rio Grande de Cagayan.
Barlig makes and wears a carved wooden hat, either hemispherical or
slightly oval. It goes in trade to Ambawan.</p>
<p>The men of the Bontoc area also have a basket-work, conical rain
hat. It is waterproof, being covered with beeswax. It is called
&ldquo;s&#277;g-fi&prime;,&rdquo; and is worn only when it rains, at
which time the suk&prime;-l&acirc;ng is often not removed.</p>
<p>About the age of 10 the boys frequently affect a girdle. These
girdles are of four varieties. The one most common in Bontoc and Samoki
is the song-kit-an&prime;, made of braided bark-fiber strings, some six
to twelve in number and about <span class="measure" title=
"3.6 meters">12 feet</span> long. They are doubled, and so make the
girdle about <span class="measure" title="1.8 meters">6 feet</span> in
length. The strings are the twisted inner bark of the same plants that
play a large r&ocirc;le in the manufacture of the woman&rsquo;s skirt.
This girdle is usually worn twice around the body, though it is also
employed as an apron, passing only once around the body and hanging
down over the genitals (see <a href="#pl021">Pl. XXI</a>). Another
girdle worn much in Tukukan, Kanyu, and Tulubin is called the
&ldquo;i-k&#301;t&prime;.&rdquo; It is made of six to twelve braided
strings of bejuco (see <a href="#pl080">Pl. LXXX</a>). It is
constructed to fit the waist, has loops at both ends, passes once
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4837" href="#xd21e4837" name=
"xd21e4837">112</a>]</span>around the body, and fastens by a cord
passing from one loop to the other. Both the sang-ki-tan&prime; and the
i-k&#301;t&prime; are made by the women. A third class of girdles is
made by the men. It is called ka&prime;-kot, and is worn and attached
quite as is the i-k&#301;t&prime;. It is a twisted rope of bejuco,
often <span class="measure" title="25 millimeters">an inch</span> in
diameter, and is much worn in Mayinit. A fourth girdle, called
&ldquo;ka&prime;-ch&#301;ng,&rdquo; is a chain, frequently a dog chain
of iron purchased on the coast, oftener a chain manufactured by the
men, and consisting of large, open links of commercial brass wire about
<span class="measure" title="4 millimeters">one-sixth of an inch</span>
in diameter.</p>
<p>At about the age of puberty, say at 15, it is usual for the boy to
possess a breechcloth, or wa&prime;-n&#301;s. However, the cloth is
worn by a large per cent of men in Bontoc and Samoki, not as a
breechcloth but tucked under the girdle and hanging in front simply as
an apron. Within the Bontoc area fully 50 per cent of the men wear the
breechcloth simply as an apron.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of breechcloths in the area. The
simplest of these is of flayed tree bark. It is made by women in
Barlig, Tulubin, Titipan, Agawa, and other pueblos. It is made of white
and reddish-brown bark, and sometimes the white ones are colored with
red ocher. The white one is called &ldquo;so&prime;-put&rdquo; and the
red one &ldquo;ti-nan&prime;-ag.&rdquo; Some of the other breechcloths
are woven of cotton thread by the women. Much of this cotton is claimed
by the Igorot to be tree cotton which they gather, spin and weave, but
much also comes in trade from the Ilokano at the coast. Some is
purchased in the boll and some is purchased after it has been spun and
colored. Many breechcloths are now bought ready made from the
Ilokano.</p>
<p>Men generally carry a bag tucked under the girdle, and very often
indeed these bags are worn in lieu of the breechcloth aprons&mdash;the
girdle and the bag apron being the only clothing (see <a href=
"#pl125">Pl. CXXV</a> and also <a href="#pl000">Frontispiece</a>,
where, from left to right, figs. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 wear simply a bag).
One of the bags commonly worn is the fi-chong&prime;, the bladder of
the hog; the other, cho&prime;-kao, is a cloth bag some <span class=
"measure" title="20 centimeters">8 inches</span> wide and <span class=
"measure" title="38 centimeters">15 inches</span> long. These cloth
bags are woven in most of the pueblos where the cotton breechcloth is
made.</p>
<p>Old men now and then wear a blanket, pi&prime;-tay, but the younger
men never do. They say a blanket is for the women.</p>
<p>Some few of the principal men in many of the pueblos throughout the
area have in late years acquired either the Army blue-woollen shirt, a
cotton shirt, or a thin coat, and these they wear during the cold
storms of January and February, and on special social occasions.</p>
<p>During the period of preparing the soil for transplanting palay the
men frequently wear nothing at the middle except the girdle. In and out
of the pueblo they work, carrying loads of manure from the hogpens to
the fields, apparently as little concerned or noticed as though they
wore their breechcloths. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4870" href=
"#xd21e4870" name="xd21e4870">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>All Igorot&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;sleep without
breechcloth, skirt, or jacket. If a woman owns a blanket she uses it as
a covering when the nights are cold. All wear basket-work nightcaps,
called &ldquo;kut&prime;-lao.&rdquo; They are made to fit closely on
the head, and have a small opening at the top. They may be worn to keep
the hair from snarling, though I was unable to get any reason from the
Igorot for their use, save that they were worn by their ancestors.</p>

<h6 class="main">Woman&rsquo;s clothing</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From infancy to the age of 8 and very often 10 years
the little girls are naked; not unfrequently one sees about the pueblo
a girl of a dozen years entirely nude. However, practically all girls
from about 5 years, and also all women, have blankets which are worn
when it is cold, as almost invariably after sundown, though no pretense
is made to cover their nakedness with them. During the day this
pi&prime;-tay, or blanket, is seldom worn except in the dance. I have
never seen women or girls dance without it. The blankets of the girls
are usually small and white with a blue stripe down each side and
through the middle; they are called &ldquo;k&ucirc;d-pas&prime;.&rdquo;
Those of the women are of four kinds&mdash;the t&#301;-na&prime;-pi,
the fa-y&#301;-ong&prime;, the fan-che&prime;-la, and the
pi-nag-pa&prime;-gan. In Barlig, Agawa, and Tulubin the flayed
tree-bark blanket is worn; and in Kambulo, east of Barlig, woven
bark-fiber blankets are made which sometimes come to Bontoc.</p>
<p>Before a girl puts on her lu-f&#301;d&prime;, or woven bark-fiber
skirt, at about 8 or 10 years of age, she at times wears simply the
narrow girdle, later worn to hold up the skirt. The skirt is both short
and narrow. It usually extends from below the navel to near the knees.
It opens on the side, and is frequently so scant and narrow that one
leg is exposed as the person walks, the only part of the body covered
on that side being under the girdle, or wa&prime;-k&#301;s&mdash;a
woven band about <span class="measure" title="10 centimeters">4
inches</span> wide passing twice around the body (see <a href=
"#pl023">Pl. XXIII</a>). The women sometimes wear the braided-string
bejuco belt, i-k&#301;t&prime;, worn by the men.</p>
<p>The lu-f&#301;d&prime; and the wa&prime;-k&#301;s are the extent of
woman&rsquo;s ordinary clothing. For some months after the mother gives
birth to a child she wears an extra wa&prime;-k&#301;s wrapped tightly
about her, over which the skirt is worn as usual. During the last few
weeks of pregnancy the woman may leave off her skirt entirely, wearing
simply her blanket over one shoulder and about her body. Women wear
breechcloths during the three or four days of menstruation.</p>
<p>During the period when the water-soaked soil of the sementera is
turned for transplanting palay the women engaged in such labor
generally lay aside their skirts. Sometimes they retain a girdle and
tuck an apron of camote leaves or of weeds under it before and behind.
I have frequently come upon women entirely naked climbing up and down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4890" href="#xd21e4890" name=
"xd21e4890">114</a>]</span>the steep, stone dikes of their sementeras
while weeding them, and also at the clay pits where Samoki women get
their earth for making pottery. In May, 1903, it rained hard every
afternoon for two or three hours in Bontoc pueblo, and at such times
the women out of doors uniformly removed their clothing. They worked in
the fields and went from the fields to their dwellings nude, wearing on
their heads while in the trail either their long, basket rain protector
or a head covering of camote vines, under which reposed their skirts in
an effort to keep them dry. Sometimes while passing our house en route
from the field to the pueblo the women wore the girdle with the
camote-vine apron, called pay-pay. Often no girdle was worn, but the
women held a small bunch of leaves against the body in lieu of an
attached apron. Sometimes, however, their hands were occupied with
their burdens, and their nudity seemed not to trouble them in the
least. The women remove their skirts, they say, because they usually
possess only one at a time, and they prefer to go naked in the rain and
while working in the wet sementeras rather than sit in a wet skirt when
they reach home.</p>
<p>Few women in the Bontoc area wear jackets or waists. Those to the
west, toward the Province of Lepanto, frequently wear short ones, open
in front without fastening, and having quarter sleeves. Those women
also wear somewhat longer skirts than do the Bontoc women.</p>
<p>In Agawa, and near-by pueblos to the west, and in Barlig and
vicinity to the east, the women make and wear flayed-bark jackets and
skirts. From Barlig bark jackets for women come in trade to Tulubin.
They are not simply sheets of bark, but the bark is strengthened by a
coarse reinforcement of a warp sewed or quilted.</p>
<p>Many of the women&rsquo;s skirts and girdles woven west of Bontoc
pueblo are made also of the Ilokano cotton. The skirts and girdles of
Bontoc pueblo and those found commonly eastward are entirely of Igorot
production. Four varieties of plants yield the threads; the inner bark
is gathered and then spun or twisted on the naked thigh under the palm
of the hand (see <a href="#pl083">Pl. LXXXIII</a>).</p>
<p>All weaving in Igorot land is done by the woman with the simplest
kind of loom, such as is scattered the world over among primitive
people. It is well shown in <a href="#pl084">Pl. LXXXIV</a>, which is a
photograph of a Lepanto Igorot loom.</p>

<p class="first">It is only after one has brought together all the
implements and utensils of an Igorot pueblo that he realizes the large
part played in it by basket work. Were basketry and pottery cut from
the list of his productions the Igorot&rsquo;s everyday labors would be
performed with bare hands and crude sticks. <span class=

<p>Where is the Igorot&rsquo;s &ldquo;stone age&rdquo;? There are stone
hammers and stones used as anvils in the ironsmith&rsquo;s shop. There
are stone troughs or bowls in most pigpens in which the animal&rsquo;s
food is placed. Very rarely, as in the Quiangan area, one sees a large,
flat stone supported <span class="measure" title=
"30 to 60 centimeters">a foot or two</span> from the earth by other
stones. It is used as a bench or table, but has no special purpose.
There are whetstones for sharpening the steel spear and battle-ax;
there is the stone of the &ldquo;flint-and-steel&rdquo; fire machine;
and of course stones are employed as seats, in constructing terrace
walls, in dams, and in the building of various inhabited structures,
but that is all. There is no &ldquo;stone age&rdquo;&mdash;no memory of
it&mdash;and, if the people were swept away to-day, to-morrow would
reveal no trace of it. It is believed that the Igorot is to-day as much
in the &ldquo;stone age&rdquo; as he ever has been in his present land.
He had little use for stone weapons, implements, or utensils before he
manufactured in iron.</p>
<p>Before he had iron he was essentially a user and maker of weapons,
implements, utensils, and tools of wood. There are many vestiges of the
wood age to-day; several show the use of wood for purposes usually
thought of as solely within the sphere of stone and metal. Among these
vestiges may be noted the bamboo knife used in circumcision; the sharp
stick employed in the ceremonial killing of domestic hogs in Benguet;
the bamboo instrument of ten or a dozen cutting blades used to shape
and dress the hard, wooden spear shafts and battle-ax handles; the use
of bamboo spearheads attached to hard-wood shafts; and the bamboo
spikes stuck in trails to impale the enemy.</p>
<p>In addition to the above uses of wood for cutting flesh and working
wood there follow, in this and subsequent chapters, enough data
regarding the uses of wood to demonstrate that the wood age plays a
large part in the life of a primitive people prior to the common use of
metals. Without metals there was practically no occasion for the
development of stone weapons and tools in a country with such woods as
the bamboo; so in the Philippines we find an order of development
different from that widespread in the temperate zones&mdash;the
&ldquo;stone age&rdquo; appears to be omitted.</p>

<h6 class="main">Wooden implements and utensils</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The kay-kay (<a href="#pl061">Pl. LXI</a>) is one of
the most indispensable wooden tools in Igorot land. It is a hard-wood
implement from <span class="measure" title="150 to 210 centimeters">5
to 7 feet</span> long, sharpened to a dull, flat edge at one end; this
end is fire tempered to harden and bind the fibers, thus preventing
splitting and excessive wear. The kay-kay is obtained in the mountains
in the vicinity of most pueblos, so it is seldom bought or sold. It is
the soil-turning stick, used by both men and women in turning the earth
in all irrigated sementeras for rice and camotes. It is also employed
in digging around and prying out rocks to be removed from sementeras or
needed for walls. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4935" href=
"#xd21e4935" name="xd21e4935">116</a>]</span>It is spade, plow, pickax,
and crowbar. A small per cent of the kay-kay is shod with an iron
point, rendering them more efficient, especially in breaking up new or
sod ground.</p>
<p>The su-wan&prime;, the woman&rsquo;s camote stick, is about
<span class="measure" title="60 centimeters">2 feet</span> long and
<span class="measure" title="2&frac12; centimeters">an inch</span> in
diameter (<a href="#pl075">Pl. LXXV</a>). It is a heavy, compact wood,
and is used by the woman until worn down <span class="measure" title=
"15 or 20 centimeters">6 or 8 inches</span>, when it usually becomes
the property of a small girl for gathering wild plants for the family
pigs. The su-wan&prime; of the woman of Bontoc and Samoki comes, mostly
in trade, from the mountains near Tulubin. It is employed in picking
the earth loose in all unirrigated sementeras, as those for camotes,
millet, beans, and maize. It is also used to pick over the earth in
camote sementeras when the crop is gathered. Perhaps 1 per cent of
these sticks is shod with an iron point. Such an instrument is of
genuine service in the rough, stony mountain lands, but is not so
serviceable as the unshod stick in the irrigated sementeras, because it
cuts and bruises the vegetables.</p>
<p>The most common wooden vessel in the Bontoc area is the
kak-wan&prime;, a vessel, or &ldquo;pail&rdquo; holding about
<span class="measure" title="six or eight liters">six or eight
quarts</span>. In it the cooked food of the pigs is mixed and carried
to the animals. Every household has two or more of them.</p>
<p>A few small, poorly made wooden dishes, called
&ldquo;chu&prime;-yu,&rdquo; are found in each dwelling, from which the
people eat broth of fish or other meats. All are of inferior
workmanship and, in common with all things of wood made by the Igorot,
are the product of the man&rsquo;s art. Both the knife and fire are
used to hollow out these bowls.</p>
<p>A long-handled wooden dipper, called &ldquo;ka-od&prime;,&rdquo; is
found in every dwelling. It belongs with the kak-wan&prime;, the
pig-food pail.</p>
<p>T&ucirc;g-on&prime; is a large, long-handled spoon used exclusively
as a drinking dipper for the fermented liquor called
&ldquo;sa-fu-&#277;ng&prime;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fa&prime;-nu is a wooden ladle employed in cooking foods.</p>
<p>A few very crude eating spoons, about the size of the dessert spoon
of America, are found in most dwellings. They are usually without
ornament, and are called &ldquo;i-ch&ucirc;s&prime;.&rdquo;</p>

<h6 class="main">Metal implements and utensils</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The wa&prime;-say is the only metal implement employed
at all commonly in the area; it is found in each family. It consists of
an iron, steel-bitted blade from <span class="measure" title=
"25 millimeters">an inch</span> to <span class="measure" title=
"40 millimeters">an inch and a half</span> in width and about
<span class="measure" title="150 millimeters">6 inches</span> in
length. It is attached to the short, wooden handle by a square haft
inserted into the handle. Since the haft is square the implement may be
instantly converted into either an &ldquo;ax&rdquo; with blade parallel
to the handle or an &ldquo;adz&rdquo; with blade at right angle to the
handle.</p>
<p>This is the tool used in felling and cutting up all trees, and in
getting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4982" href="#xd21e4982"
name="xd21e4982">117</a>]</span>out and dressing all timbers and
boards. It is the sole carpenter tool, unless the man by chance possess
a bolo.</p>
<p>There are no metal agricultural implements in common use. As was
noted earlier in the chapter, the soil-turning stick and the
woman&rsquo;s camote stick are now and then shod with iron, but they
are rare.</p>
<p>There are a few large, shallow Chinese iron boilers in the area,
used especially for boiling sugar, evaporating salt in Mayinit, and for
cooking carabao or large quantities of hog on ceremonial occasions.
There are probably not more than two or three dozen such boilers in
Bontoc pueblo, though they are becoming much more plentiful during the
past three years&mdash;since the Igorot has more money and goes more
often to Candon on the coast, where he buys them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div5 subsection" id="xd21e4988">
<div class="divHead">
<h6 class="main">Pottery</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most of the pottery consumed in the Bontoc area is the
product of Samoki, the sister pueblo of Bontoc. Samoki pottery meets no
competition down the river to the north until in the vicinity of
Bitwagan, which makes and vends similar ware both up and down the
river. To the south there is also competition, since Data makes and
sells an excellent pot to Antedao, Fidelisan, Sagada, Titipan, and
other near-by pueblos. It is probable, also, that Lias and Barlig, to
the east, are supplied with pottery, and, if so, that their source is
Bitwagan. But Bitwagan and Data pots are really not competitors with
those of Samoki; they rather supply areas which the Samoki potters can
not reach because of distance and the hostility of the people.</p>
<p>There are no traditions clustering around pottery making in Samoki.
The potters say they taught themselves, and have always made
earthenware.</p>
<p>To-day Samoki pottery is made of two clays&mdash;one a reddish-brown
mineral dug from pits <span class="measure" title=
"about a meter">several feet</span> deep on the hillside, shown in
<a href="#pl082">Pl. LXXXII</a>, and the other a bluish mineral
gathered from a shallow basin situated on the hillside nearer the river
than the pits, and in which a little water stands much of the year.</p>
<p>Formerly Samoki made pottery of only the brown clay, and she used
cut grass intermixed for a temper, but she claims those earlier pots
were too porous to glaze well. Consequently the experiment was made of
adding the blue surface clay, in which there is a considerable amount
of fresh and decaying vegetable matter&mdash;probably sufficient to
give temper, although the potters do not recognize it as such.</p>
<p>Samoki consists of eight ato, one of which is I-kang&prime;-a.
occupying the outer fringe of dwellings on the northwest side of the
pueblo. It is claimed that all of the women of I-kang&prime;-a, whether
married or single, are potters. Even women who marry men of the
I-kang&prime;-a ato, and who come to that section of the pueblo to
live, learn and follow the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5007"
href="#xd21e5007" name="xd21e5007">118</a>]</span>potter&rsquo;s art. A
few married women in other ato also manufacture pottery. They seem to
be married daughters of I-kang&prime;-a ato.</p>
<p>A fine illustration of community industry is presented by the ato
potters of Samoki. It could not be learned that there are any definite
regulations, other than custom, demanding that all women of
I-kang&prime;-a manufacture pots, or any regulation which forces
daughters of that ato to discontinue the art when they marry outside.
But custom has fixed quite rigidly such a regulation, and though, as
just stated, a few I-kang&prime;-a women married into other ato of
Samoki do manufacture pottery, yet no I-kang&prime;-a women married
into other pueblos carry on the art. It may be argued that a lack of
suitable clay has thwarted manufacture in other pueblos, but clay is
common in the mountains of the area, and the sources of the materials
used in Samoki are readily accessible to at least the pueblo of Bontoc,
where also there are many Samoki women living.</p>
<p>The clay pits lie north of Samoki, between <span class="measure"
title="400 and 800 meters">a quarter and a half of a mile</span>
distant, and the potters go to them in the early morning while the
earth is moist, and dig and bring home the clays. The woman gathers
half a transportation basket of each of the clays, and while at the
pits crudely works both together into balls <span class="measure"
title="10 or 13 centimeters">4 or 5 inches</span> in diameter. In this
form the clay is carried to the pueblo.</p>
<p>All the pottery is manufactured in the shade of the potter&rsquo;s
dwelling, and the first process is a thorough mixing of the two clays.
The balls of the crudely mixed material are put into a small, wooden
trough, are slightly moistened, and then thoroughly worked with a
wooden pestle, the potter crouching on her haunches or resting on her
knees during the labors. She is shown in <a href="#pl089">Pl.
LXXXIX</a> <i>a</i>. After the clay is mixed it is manipulated in small
handfuls, between the thumb and fingers, in order that all stones and
coarse pieces of vegetable matter may be removed. When the mortarful
has thus been handled it is ready for making pots.</p>
<p>A mass of this clay, thoroughly mixed and plastic, is placed on a
board on the earth before the kneeling or crouched potter. She pokes a
hole in the top of this mass with thumbs and fingers, and quickly
enlarges it. As soon as the opening is large enough to admit one hand
it is dug out and enlarged by scraping with the ends of the fingers,
and the clay so gathered is immediately built onto the upper rim of the
mass. The inside is next further scraped and smoothed with the side of
the forefinger. At this juncture a small mass of clay is rolled into a
strip between the hands and placed on the upper edge of the shaping
mass, completely encircling it. This roll is at once shaped by the
hands into a crude, flaring rim. A few swift touches on the outer face
of the crude pot removes protruding masses and roughly shapes the
surface. The rim is moistened with water and smoothed inside and out by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5029" href="#xd21e5029" name=
"xd21e5029">119</a>]</span>hand and a short, round stick. This process
is well illustrated in <a href="#pl090">Pl. XC</a>. The first stage of
manufacture is completed and the vessel is set in the sun with the rim
of an old broken pot for a supporting base.</p>
<p>In the course of a few hours the shaped and nearly completed rim of
the pot becomes strong and set by the heat of the sun. However, the
rough and irregular bowl has apparently retained relatively a larger
amount of moisture and is in prime condition to be thinned, expanded,
and given final form. The pot is now handled by the rim, which is
sufficiently rigid for the purpose, and is turned about on its
supporting base as is needed, or the base is turned about on the earth
like a crude &ldquo;potter&rsquo;s wheel.&rdquo; A smooth discoidal
stone, some <span class="measure" title="10 or 13 centimeters">4 or 5
inches</span> in diameter, and a wooden paddle are the instruments used
to shape the bowl. The paddle is first dipped in water and rubbed over
one of the flattish surfaces of the stone slightly to moisten it, and
is then beaten against the outer surface of the bowl, while the stone,
tapped against the inner surface, prevents indenting or cracking, and,
by offering a more or less nonresisting surface, assists in thinning
and expanding the clay. After the upper part of the bowl has been thus
completed the potter sits on her feet and haunches, with her knees
thrust forward from her. Again and again she moistens her paddle and
discoidal stone, and continues the spanking process until the entire
bowl of the pot is shaped. It is then set in the sun to dry&mdash;this
time usually bottom side up.</p>
<p>After it has thoroughly dried, both the inner and outer surfaces are
carefully and patiently smoothed and polished with a small stone,
commonly a ribbon agate. During this process all pebbles found
protruding from the surface are removed and the pits are filled with
new clay thoroughly smoothed in place, and the thickness of the pot is
made more uniform. The vessel is again placed on its supporting base in
the sun, and kept turned and tilted until it has become well dried and
set. Two and sometimes three days are required to bring a pot thus far
toward completion, though during the same time there are several
equally completed by each potter.</p>
<p>There remains yet the burning and glazing. Samoki burns her pots in
the morning before sunrise. Immediately on the outskirts of the pueblo
there is a large, gravelly place strewn with thin, black ash where for
generations the potters coming and going have completed their primitive
ware. Usually two or more firings occur each week, and several women
combine and burn their pots together. On the earth small stones are
laid upon which one tier of vessels is placed, each lying upon its
side. Tier upon tier of pots is then placed above the first layer, each
on its side and each supported by and supporting other pots. The heat
is supplied by pine bark placed beneath and around the lower layer. The
pile is entirely blanketed with dead grass tied in small <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5044" href="#xd21e5044" name=
"xd21e5044">120</a>]</span>bunches which has been gathered, prepared,
and kept in the houses of the potters for the purpose. The grass
retains its form long after the blaze and glow have ceased, and clings
about the pile as a blanket, checking the wasteful radiation of heat
and cutting out the drafts of air that would be disastrous to the
heated clay. As this blanket of grass finally gives way here and there
the attending potters replenish it with more bunches. The pile is fired
about one hour; when sufficiently baked the pots are lifted from the
fire by inserting in each a long pole. Each potter then takes a vessel
at a time, places it red hot on its supporting base on the earth before
her, and immediately proceeds, with much care and labor, to glaze the
rim and inside of the bowl. The glaze is a resin obtained in trade from
Barlig. It is applied to the vessel from the end of a glazing
stick&mdash;sometimes a pole <span class="measure" title=
"about 2 meters">6 or 7 feet</span> long, but usually about
<span class="measure" title="a meter">a yard</span> in length. After
the rim and inner surface of the bowl have been thoroughly glazed the
potter begins on another vessel&mdash;turning the last one over to one
or two little girls, from 4 to 6 years of age, who find great happiness
in smearing the outer surface of the now cooling and dull-brown pot
with resin held in bunches in the hands. This outer glaze, applied by
the young apprentices, who, in play, are learning an art of their
future womanhood, is neither so thick nor so carefully laid as is the
glaze of the rim and inner surface of the vessel. When the glazing is
completed the pot is still too hot to be borne in the hands; however,
the glaze has become rigid and hard.</p>
<p>Analyses made at the Bureau of Government Laboratories, Manila, show
that the clays used in the Samoki pots contain the following

<p>The botanist of the Bureau of Government Laboratories<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5140src" href="#xd21e5140" name="xd21e5140src">4</a>
says in the report of his analysis of the resin used to glaze these
pots:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">This gum is known as Almaciga (Sp.). It is produced by
some species of the dipterocarpus or shorea&mdash;which it is

"#xd21e5153" name="xd21e5153src">5</a> who analyzed the clays and
examined the finished and glazed pots says of the Samoki pot that about
two-thirds of the organic matter in the clay is consumed in the baking
or burning of the pot. The organic matter in the middle one-third of
the wall of the pot is not consumed. The clay is a remarkably hard one
and is difficult of ignition; this is the reason it makes good cooking
vessels. He further says that the glaze is not a true glaze. It seems
that the resin does nothing except <span class="corr" title=

and there is left on the surface the unconsumed carbon.</p>

<h6 class="main">Basket work</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All basket work is done by the men. Much of the time
when they are in the fawi or pabafunan, gossiping and smoking, they are
busied making the ordinary and necessary utensils of the field and
dwelling. The basket work is all crude, with the possible exception of
some of the hats worn by the men.</p>
<p>As is brought forth later under the head of &ldquo;Commerce,&rdquo;
much basket work is done by only one or two communities, and from them
passes in trade over a large area. Most of the basket work of the area
is of bejuco or bamboo. There are two varieties of bamboo used in the
area&mdash;a&prime;-n&#301;s and fi&prime;-ka. A&prime;-n&#301;s is
found in the area and fi&prime;-ka is brought in in trade from the
southwest.</p>
<p>The most important piece of basket work is the ki-ma&prime;-ta, the
man&rsquo;s transportation basket, made of a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo; it
is shown in <a href="#pl120">Pl. CXX</a>. It is made by many pueblos,
and is found throughout the area. It consists of two baskets joined
firmly to a light, wooden crossbar called &ldquo;pa&prime;-tang.&rdquo;
The entire ki-ma&prime;-ta weighs about <span class="measure" title=
"2&frac12; kilograms">5 pounds</span>, and with it the Igorot carries
loads weighing as much as <span class="measure" title=
"45 kilograms">100 pounds</span>.</p>
<p>The man has another basket called &ldquo;ko-chuk-kod&prime;,&rdquo;
which is used frequently by him, also sometimes by women, for carrying
earth when building the sementeras. The ko-chuk-kod&prime; is made in
Bontoc and Samoki. It is not shown in any of the illustrations, but is
quite similar to the tay-ya-an&prime;, or large transportation basket
of the woman, yet is slimmer. It is also similar in shape and size to
the woman&rsquo;s transportation basket in Benguet which is worn on the
back supported by a headband.</p>
<p>The woman has two important <span class="corr" title=
"Source: a&prime;-n&#301;s-bamboo">a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo</span>
transportation baskets, which are constantly employed. One called
&ldquo;lu&prime;-wa,&rdquo; the shallow lower basket shown in <a href=
"#pl085">Pl. LXXV</a>, is made only in Samoki; the other
tay-ya-an&prime;, shown in <a href="#pl093">Pl. XCIII</a>, holds about
<span class="measure" title="25 liters">three pecks</span>. It is made
only in Bontoc and Samoki.</p>
<p>Ag-ka-win&prime; is the small rump basket almost invariably worn by
women <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5195" href="#xd21e5195" name=
"xd21e5195">122</a>]</span>when working in the irrigated sementera. It
is of fi&prime;-ka bamboo, is made commonly in Bontoc and Samoki, and
occasionally in Tulubin. The field toiler often carries her lunch to
the field in the ag-ka-win&prime;, and when she returns the basket is
usually filled with crustaceans and mollusks picked up in the wet
sementera or gathered in the river, or with weeds or grasses to be
cooked as &ldquo;greens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s rain protector, a scoop-shaped affair about
<span class="measure" title="120 centimeters">4 feet long</span>,
called &ldquo;t&ucirc;g-wi&prime;,&rdquo; is said to be made only in
Ambawan and Barlig. It consists of a double weave of coarse splints,
between which is a waterproof layer of a large palm leaf. It is worn
over the head, and is an excellent protection from the rain. It may
well have been suggested to primitive man by the banana leaf, which I
have repeatedly seen carried over the head and back by the Igorot in
many sections of northern Luzon during the rains. I have also seen it
used many times in Manila by Tagalog who were caught out in a storm
without an umbrella. The rain protector is shown lying in front of the
house in <a href="#pl037">Pl. XXXVII</a>.</p>
<p>Tak-o-ch&ucirc;g&prime; is the man&rsquo;s dirt scoop made of
a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo. It resembles the t&ucirc;g-wi&prime; in
shape, but is only about <span class="measure" title=
"45 centimeters">1&frac12; feet</span> long. It is employed in handling
earth, and conveying the dirt to the ko-chuk-kod&prime;, or dirt
transportation basket.</p>
<p>A basket very similar to tak-o-ch&ucirc;g&prime;, but called
&ldquo;s&ucirc;g-fi&prime;,&rdquo; is employed by the woman in her
housework in handling vegetables. It is shown in <a href="#pl094">Pl.
XCIV</a>, containing camote parings.</p>
<p>The to&prime;-p&#301;l is the man&rsquo;s &ldquo;dinner pail.&rdquo;
It is made of a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo, is a covered basket, and is
constructed to contain from <span class="measure" title=
"from one and a half to three liters">one and a half to three
quarts</span> of solid food. In it men and boys carry their lunch to
the fields. All the pueblos make the to&prime;-p&#301;l.</p>
<p>Another basket, called &ldquo;sang&prime;-i,&rdquo; is generally
employed in carrying the man&rsquo;s food. It is used for long trips
from home, although I have seen it used simply for carrying the field
lunch. It is made of bejuco in Ambawan, Barlig, and Tulubin, and passes
widely in the area through commerce. It is worn on the back, secured by
bejuco straps passing in front of the shoulders.</p>
<p>Fang&prime;-ao is the sang&prime;-i with a waterproof bejuco
covering. As it is worn on the back, the man appears to be wearing a
cape made of hanging vegetable threads. This is the basket commonly
known as the &ldquo;head basket,&rdquo; but it is used for carrying
food, blankets, anything, on the trail. It is made in Ambawan, Barlig,
and Kanyu, and is found pretty well scattered throughout the area. It
is shown, front and back view, in <a href="#pl095">Pl. XCV</a>.</p>
<p>Fa&prime;-i si gang&prime;-sa is an open-work bejuco basket, in
shape very similar to the sang&prime;-i, used to carry the
gang&prime;-sa, or metal drum. It is worn slung on the back as is the
sang&prime;-i.</p>
<p>A house basket holding about <span class="measure" title=
"9 liters">a peck</span>, called &ldquo;fa-lo&prime;-ko,&rdquo; is made
of a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo. It is used in various capacities, for
vegetables and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5235" href=
"#xd21e5235" name="xd21e5235">123</a>]</span>cereals, in and about the
house. It is made in all the pueblos and is shown in <a href=
"#pl094">Pl. XCIV</a>. A few other household baskets are often found.
Among these are the large, bottle-shaped locust basket,
i-w&ucirc;s&prime;, a smaller basket, ko&prime;-lug, of the same shape
used to hold threshed rice, and the open-work spoon basket,
so&prime;-long, which usually hangs over the fireplace in each
dwelling.</p>
<p>The large winnowing tray, l&#301;g-o&prime;, shown bottom up in
<a href="#pl093">Pl. XCIII</a>, is made in Samoki and Kanyu of
a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo. There are two sizes of winnowing trays, both
of which are employed everywhere in the area.</p>
<p>Several small <span class="corr" title=
"Source: a&prime;-n&#301;s-bamboo">a&prime;-n&#301;s bamboo</span>
eating trays, called &ldquo;ki&prime;-&ucirc;g,&rdquo; are shown in
<a href="#pl094">Pl. XCIV</a>. These food dishes are used on ceremonial
occasions, and some of them can not be purchased. They are made in all
pueblos.</p>
<p>Samoki alone is said to make the rice sieve, called
&ldquo;a-ka&prime;-&ucirc;g. It passes widely in the pueblo.</p>
<p>Aside from these various basket utensils and implements there are
the three kinds of fish traps described in the section on fishing.</p>
<p>There are also three varieties of basket-work hats. The rain hat
called &ldquo;s&#277;g-fi&prime;,&rdquo; is made in Bontoc, and may be
in imitation of those worn nearer the western coast. This with the
suk-l&acirc;ng, the pocket hat always worn by the men and boys, and the
kut&prime;-lao, or sleeping hat, worn by children and adults of both
sexes, are described under the head of &ldquo;Clothing.&rdquo;</p>

make for themselves tiny bows <span class="measure" title=
"45 or 60 centimeters">1&frac12; or 2 feet</span> long with which they
snap light arrows <span class="measure" title="a meter or two">a few
feet</span>. But the instrument is of the crudest, merely a toy, and is
a thing of the day, being acquired from the culture of the Ilokano who
live in the pueblo. The Igorot claim they never employed the bow and
arrow, and, to-day at least, consider the question as to their ever
using it as very foolish, since, they say, pointing to the
child&rsquo;s toy, &ldquo;It is nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1665&ndash;1668 Friar Casimiro Diaz wrote of the Igorot that they
used arrows,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5272src" href="#xd21e5272"
name="xd21e5272src">6</a> but it is believed his statement did not
apply to the Bontoc man. Igorot-like people throughout northern Luzon
commonly do not have this weapon, yet the large Tinguian group of Abra,
west and north of Bontoc, and the Ibilao of southeastern Nueva Vizcaya,
Nueva Ecija, and adjacent Isabela employ the bow constantly.</p>
<p>The natural projectile weapon of the Negrito is the bow and arrow;
that of the Malayan seems to be the blowgun&mdash;at present, however,
largely replaced by the spear, though in some southern islands,
especially in Paragua, it has held its own. <span class=

<h6 class="main">Wooden weapons</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Shields are universally made and used by the Igorot.
They are made by the men of each pueblo, and are seldom bought or sold.
They are cut from single pieces of wood, and are generally constructed
of very light wood, though some are heavy. The hand grip is cut in the
solid timber, is almost invariably made for the left hand, and will
usually accommodate only three fingers&mdash;the thumb and little
finger remaining outside the grip and free to press forward the upper
and lower ends of the shield, respectively, slanting it to glance a
blow of a spear.</p>
<p>Within the present boundary of Bontoc Province there are three
distinct patterns of wooden shields in use in three quite distinct
culture areas. There is still another shield immediately beyond the
western border of the province but which is believed to be produced
also in the Bontoc area.</p>
<p>First, is the shield of the Bontoc culture area. It is usually about
<span class="measure" title="a meter">3 feet</span> long and
<span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">1 foot</span> wide, is
blackened with a greasy soot, though now and again one in original wood
is seen. The upper part or &ldquo;chief&rdquo; of the shield is cut,
leaving three points projecting <span class="measure" title=
"about 10 centimeters">several inches</span> above the solid field; the
lower end or &ldquo;base&rdquo; is cut, leaving two points. Across both
ends of the shield is a strengthening lace of bejuco, passing through
perforations from front to back. The front surface of the shield is
most prominent over the deep-cut hand grip at the boss or &ldquo;fess
point,&rdquo; toward which a wing approaches on both the dexter and
sinister sides of the front of the shield, being carved slightly on the
field. This is the usual Bontoc shield, but some few have meaningless
straight-line decorations cut in the field.</p>
<p>In the Tinglayan culture area, immediately north of Bontoc, the
usual shield is very similar to the above, except that various sections
of both the face and back of the shield are of natural wood or are
colored dull red. The strengthening of bejuco lacings and the raised
wings are also found.</p>
<p>Still farther north is the Kalinga shield&mdash;a slim, gracefully
formed shield, differing from the typical Bontoc weapon chiefly in its
more graceful outline. It is of a uniform black color and has the
bejuco lacings the same as the others.</p>
<p>The fourth variety, made at Bagnen, immediately across the Bontoc
border, in Lepanto, and probably also made and certainly used near at
hand in Bontoc, is quite similar to the Bontoc type but is smaller and
cruder. It is uncolored, and on its front has crude drawings of snakes
and frogs (or perhaps men) drawn with soot paint.</p>
<p>Banawi area, south of the Bontoc area, has a shield differing
markedly from the others. It is longer, usually somewhat wider, and not
cut at either end. The lower end is straight across at right angles to
the sides; the upper end rises to a very obtuse angle at the middle.
The front is usually much plainer than is that of the other shields
mentioned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5306" href="#xd21e5306"
name="xd21e5306">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>Throughout the Bontoc area there is a spear with a bamboo blade,
entirely a wooden weapon. The spear is employed in warfare, and is
losing its place only as iron becomes plentiful enough and cheap enough
to substitute for the bamboo blades or heads. Even in sections in which
iron spears are relatively common the wooden spear is used much in
warfare, since spears thrown at an enemy are frequently lost.</p>
<p>Sharp-pointed bamboo spikes are often stuck in the trails of war
parties when they are returning from some foray in which they have been
successful. These spikes are from about <span class="measure" title=
"15 centimeters">6 inches</span> in length, as among the people of the
Bontoc area, to <span class="measure" title="a meter or more">3 or more
feet</span>, as among the Ibilao of southeastern Nueva Vizcaya. The
latter people nightly place these long spikes, called
&ldquo;luk&prime;-dun,&rdquo; in the trails leading to their dwellings.
They are placed at a considerable angle, and would impale an intruder
in the groin or upper thigh, inflicting a cruel and disabling wound.
The shorter spikes either cut through the bottom of the foot or stab
the instep or leg near the ankle. They are much dreaded, and, though
crude, are very effective weapons.</p>

<div class="div5 subsection" id="xd21e5317">
<div class="divHead">
<h6 class="main">Metal weapons</h6>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The metal spear blade or head is a product of Igorot
workmanship. Baliwang, situated about six hours north of Bontoc, makes
most of the metal spear blades used in the Bontoc area. Sapao, located
about a day and a half to the south, makes excellent metal blades, but
they seldom reach the Bontoc culture area, although blades of inferior
production from Sapao are found in Ambawan, the southernmost pueblo of
the area.</p>
<p>Baliwang has four smithies, in each of which two or three men labor,
each man in a smithy performing a separate part of the work. One
operates the bellows, another feeds the fire and does the heavy
striking during the initial part of the work, and the other&mdash;the
real blade maker, the artist&mdash;directs all the labor, and performs
the finer and finishing parts of the blade production.</p>
<p>The smithies are about <span class="measure" title=
"4 meters square">12 feet square</span> without side walls. They have a
grass roof sloping to within <span class="measure" title="a meter">3
feet</span> of the earth, enlarging the shaded area to near
<span class="measure" title="6 meters square">20 feet square</span>.
Near one side of the room is the bellows, called
&ldquo;op-op&prime;,&rdquo; consisting of two vertical, parallel wooden
tubes about <span class="measure" title="1&frac12; meters">5
feet</span> long and <span class="measure" title="25 centimeters">10
inches</span> in diameter, standing side by side. Each tube has a
piston or plunger, called &ldquo;dot-dot&prime;;&rdquo; the packing
ring of the piston is of wood covered with chicken feathers, making it
slightly flexible at the rim, so it fits snugly in the tube. The lower
end of the bellows tubes rests in the earth, <span class="measure"
title="10 centimeters">4 inches</span> above which a small bamboo tube
leads the compressed air to the fireplace from each bellows tube. These
small tubes, called &ldquo;to-bong&prime;,&rdquo; end near an opening
through a brick at the back of the fire, and the air forced through
them passes on through the brick to the burning charcoal. The outer end
of the to-bong&prime; is cut at an angle, and as the tubes end outside
the opening in the brick, the air inbreathed by the bellows, as the
plungers are raised, is drawn from back of the fireplace&mdash;thus the
fire is not disturbed.</p>
<p>The fuel is an inferior charcoal prepared by the Igorot from pine.
This bellows is found throughout the Archipelago and is evidently a
Malayan product. It is believed that it came to Bontoc with the Igorot
from their earlier home and is not, as some say, a Chinese
invention.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5347src" href="#xd21e5347" name=
"xd21e5347src">7</a> The Igorot manufacturer of metal pipes uses
exactly the same kind of bellows, except that it is very much smaller,
and so appears like a toy. It is poorly shown in <a href="#pl109">Pl.
CIX</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the iron now employed in the manufacture of Igorot weapons
is Chinese bar iron coming from China to the Islands at Candon, in
Ilokos Sur. However, the people readily make weapons from any iron they
may acquire, greatly preferring the scraps of broken Chinese cast-iron
pots, vessels purchased primarily for making sugar. In his choice of
cast iron the Igorot exhibits a practical knowledge of metallurgy,
since cast iron makes better steel than wrought iron&mdash;that is, as
he has to work.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e5358width"><img src="images/fig05.jpg" alt=
"Ironsmith&rsquo;s stone hammer." width="181" height="192">
<p class="figureHead">Ironsmith&rsquo;s stone hammer.</p>
</div>
<p>The anvils of the smithy, numbering four or five, are large rocks
set solidly in the earth. The hammers are nearly all stone, though some
of the workmen have a small iron hammer used in finishing the
weapons.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of stone hammers. One weighing about
<span class="measure" title="15 kilograms">30 pounds</span> is
<span class="measure" title="40 centimeters">16 inches</span> long,
<span class="measure" title="25 centimeters">10 inches</span> wide, and
from <span class="measure" title="10 to 15 centimeters">4 to 6
inches</span> thick. <span class="measure" title="A 25-millimeter">An
inch-deep</span> groove is cut in both edges of the hammer, and into
these grooves the short, double wooden handle is attached by a withe.
Another hammer, similar to the above in shape and attachment, is about
one-third its size and weight. There is a still smaller hammer lashed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5382" href="#xd21e5382" name=
"xd21e5382">127</a>]</span>with leather bands to a single, straight
wooden handle; and there is also a round hammer stone about
<span class="measure" title="75 millimeters">3 inches</span> in
diameter without handle or attachment, which hammer, together with the
larger one last mentioned, is largely superseded in some of the
smithies by the metal hammer.</p>
<p>The bellows operator sits squatting on a slight platform the height
of the bellows, and constantly works the plungers up and down with
rhythmic strokes.</p>
<p>Two men at first handle the hot iron&mdash;one, the real blade
maker, holds the white-hot metal with long-handled iron pinchers
(purchased in Candon) and his helper wields the <span class="measure"
title="15-kilogram">30-pound</span> hammer. He stands with legs well
apart, grasps the heavy hammer with both hands, and swings it back and
forth between his legs. The blow is struck at the downward, backward
swing.</p>
<p>These smiths weld iron, and also temper it to make steel. The
following detailed picture of a welding observed in a Baliwang smithy
may be duplicated there any day. The two pieces of iron to be welded
were separately heated a dull red. One was then laid on the other and
both were cooled with water. Wet earth, gathered for the occasion at
the side of the smithy, was then put over them; while still covered
they were inserted again in the fire. When red-hot they were withdrawn,
the little mound of earth covering the two pieces of iron being still
in place but having been brought also to a red heat. A few light blows
fell on the red mass, and it was again returned to the fire. Four times
the iron was withdrawn and received a few blows with a light hammer
wielded by the master smith. On being withdrawn the fifth time half a
dozen blows were struck by the helper with the <span class="measure"
title="15-kilogram">30-pound</span> hammer. Again the iron was heated,
but when removed the sixth time the welding was evidently considered
finished, as the shaping of the weapon was then begun. Weldings made by
these smiths seem to be complete.</p>
<p>The tempering done by the Igorot is crude, and is such as may be
seen in any country blacksmith shop in the States. The iron is heated
and is tempered by cooling in a small wooden trough of water. There is
great difference in the quality of the steel turned out by the Igorot,
even by the same man, though some men are recognized as more skillful
than others.</p>
<p>There are four styles of spear blades made by Baliwang. The one most
common is called &ldquo;fal-f&#277;g&prime;.&rdquo; It is a simple,
single-barbed blade, and ranges from <span class="measure" title=
"5 centimeters">2 inches</span> to <span class="measure" title=
"15 centimeters">6 inches</span> in length. This style of blade is the
most used in warfare, and the smaller, lighter blades are considered
better for this purpose than the heavier ones.</p>
<p>The fang&prime;-kao, or barbless lance blade, is next common in use.
It is not a war blade, but is used almost entirely in killing carabaos
and hogs. There is one notable exception to this
statement&mdash;Ambawan has almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5412" href="#xd21e5412" name="xd21e5412">128</a>]</span>no other
class of spear. These blades range from <span class="measure" title=
"10 to 30 or 35 centimeters">4 to 12 or 14 inches</span> in length.</p>
<p>The other two blades, si-na-la-wi&prime;-tan and kay-yan&prime;, are
relatively rare. The former is quite similar to the
fal-f&#277;g&prime;, except that instead of the single pair of barbs
there are other barbs&mdash;say, from one to ten pairs. This spear is
not considered at all serviceable as a hunting spear, and is not used
in war as much as is the fal-f&#277;g&prime;. It is prized highly as an
anito scarer. When a man passes alone in the mountains anito are very
prone to walk with him; however, if the traveler carries a
si-na-la-wi&prime;-tan, anito will not molest him, since they are
afraid when they see the formidable array of barbs.</p>
<p>Kay-yan&prime; is a gracefully formed blade not used in hunting, and
employed less in war than is si-na-la-wi&prime;-tan. Though the Igorot
has almost nothing in his culture for purely aesthetic purposes, yet he
ascribes no purpose for the kay-yan&prime;&mdash;he says it looks
pretty; but I have seen it carried to war by war parties.</p>
<p>The pueblo of Sapao makes superior-looking steel weapons, though
many Igorot claim the steel of the Baliwang spear is better than that
from Sapao. In Quiangan I saw a fang&prime;-kao, or lance-shaped blade
made in Sapao, having six faces on each side. The five lines separating
the faces ran from the tang to the point of the blade, and were as
regular and perfect as though machine made. The best class of Sapao
blades is readily distinguishable by its regular lines and the smooth
and perfect surface finish.</p>
<p>All spearheads are fastened to the wooden shaft by a short haft or
tang inserted in the wood. An iron ferrule or a braided bejuco ferrule
is employed to strengthen the shaft where the tang is inserted. A
conical iron ferrule or cap is also placed on the butt of the shaft.
This ferrule is often used, as the spear is always stuck in the earth
close at hand when the warrior works any distance from home; and as he
passes along the steep mountain trails or carries heavy burdens he
commonly uses the spear shaft as a staff.</p>
<p>The spear shafts are made by the owner of the weapon, it not being
customary for anyone to produce them for sale. Some of them are rather
attractively decorated with brass and copper studs, and a few have red
and yellow bejuco ferrules near the blade. In some pueblos of the
Bontoc area, as at Mayinit, spear shafts are worked down and eventually
smoothed and finished by a flexible, bamboo knife-blade machine. It
consists of about a dozen blades <span class="measure" title=
"20 or 25 centimeters">8 or 10 inches</span> in length, fastened
together side by side with string. The blades lie one overlapping the
other like the slats of an American window shutter. Each projecting
blade is sharpened to a chisel edge. The machine is grasped in the
hand, as shown in <a href="#fig06">fig. 6</a>, and is slid up and down
the shaft with a slight twisting movement obtained by bending the
wrist. The machine becomes a flexible, many-bladed plane. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5433" href="#xd21e5433" name=
"xd21e5433">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>Baliwang alone makes the genuine Bontoc battle-ax. It is a strong,
serviceable blade of good temper, and is hafted to a short, strong,
straight wooden handle which is strengthened by a ferrule of iron or
braided bejuco. The ax has a slender point opposed to the bit or
cutting edge of the blade. This point is often thrust in the earth and
the upturned blade used as a stationary knife, on which the Igorot cuts
meats and other substances by drawing them lengthwise along the sharp
edge. The bit of the ax is at a small angle with the front and back
edges of the blade, and is nearly a straight line. The axes are kept
keen and sharp by whetstones collected and preserved solely for the
purpose. Besao, near Sagada, quarries and barters a good grade of
whetstone.</p>

"images/fig06.jpg" alt="Bamboo spear-shaft dresser." width="308"
height="344">
<p class="figureHead">Bamboo spear-shaft dresser.</p>
</div>
<p>A slender, long-handled battle-ax now and then comes into the area
in trade from the north. Balbelasan, of old Abra Province, but now in
the northern part of extended Bontoc Province, is one of the pueblos
which produce this beautiful ax. The blade is longer and very much
slimmer than the Bontoc blade, but its marked distinguishing feature is
the shape of the cutting edge. The blade is ground on two straight
lines joined together by a short curved line, giving the edge the
striking form of the beak of a rapacious bird. The slender, graceful
handle, always fitted with a long iron ferrule, has a process on the
under side near the middle. The handle is also usually fitted with a
decorated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5442" href="#xd21e5442"
name="xd21e5442">130</a>]</span>metal ferrule at the tip and frequently
is decorated for its full length with bands of brass or tin, or with
sheets of either metal artistically incised.</p>
<p>The Balbelasan ax is not used by the pueblos making it, or at least
by many of them, but finds its field of usefulness east and northeast
of Bontoc pueblo as far as the foothills of the mountains west of the
Rio Grande de Cagayan. I was told by the Kalinga of this latter region
that the people in the mountain close to the Cagayan in the vicinity of
Cabagan Nuevo, Isabela Province, also use this ax.</p>
<p>In the southern and western part of the Bontoc area the battle-ax
shares place with the bolo, the sole hand weapon of the Igorot of
adjoining Lepanto, Benguet, and Nueva Vizcaya Provinces.</p>
<p>The bolo within the Bontoc area comes from Sapao and from the
Ilokano people of the west coast. The southern pueblo in the Bontoc
area, Ambawan, uses the bolo of Sapao to the entire exclusion of the
battle-ax. Tulubin, the next pueblo to Ambawan, and only an hour from
it, uses almost solely the Baliwang battle-ax. Such pueblos as Titipan
and Antedao, about three hours west of Bontoc, use both the ax and
bolo, while the pueblos further west, as Agawa, Sagada, Balili, Alap,
etc., use the bolo exclusively&mdash;frequently an Ilokano weapon.</p>
<p>The Sapao bolo is, in appearance, superior to that of Ilokano
manufacture. It is a broad blade swelling markedly toward the center,
and is somewhat similar in shape to the barong of the Sulu Moro of the
Sulu Archipelago. This weapon finds its chief field of use in the
Quiangan and Banawi areas. In these districts the bolo is fitted with
an open scabbard, and the bright blade presents a novel appearance
lying exposed against the red scabbard. The Igorot manufacturer of the
bolo does not make the scabbard, and most of the bolos used within the
Bontoc area are sheathed in the closed wooden scabbard commonly found
in Lepanto and Benguet.</p>

<h5 class="main">Pipe production, and smoking</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot of Bontoc area make pipes of wood, clay,
and metal. All their pipes have small bores and bowls. In Benguet a
wooden pipe is commonly made with a bowl <span class="measure" title=
"4 centimeters">an inch and a half</span> in diameter; it has a large
bore also. In Banawi I obtained a wooden pipe with a bowl <span class=
"measure" title="21 centimeters">8&frac14; inches</span> in
circumference and <span class="measure" title="10 centimeters">4
inches</span> in height, but having a bore averaging only <span class=
"measure" title="13 millimeters">half an inch</span> in diameter.</p>
<p>Nearly all pueblos make the pipes they use, but pipes of clay and
metal are manufactured by the Igorot for Igorot trade. I never learned
that wooden pipes are made by them for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The wooden pipe of the area varies from simple tubular forms,
exactly like a modern cigar holder, to those having bowls set at right
angle to the stem. All wooden pipes are whittled by the men, and some
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5474" href="#xd21e5474" name=
"xd21e5474">131</a>]</span>them are very graceful in form and have an
excellent polish. They are made of at least three kinds of
wood&mdash;ga-sa&prime;-tan, la-no&prime;-ti, and gi-gat&prime;. Most
pipes&mdash;wooden, clay, or metal&mdash;have separable stems.</p>
<p>A few men in Agawa, a pueblo near the western border of the area,
make beautiful clay pipes, called &ldquo;ki-na-lo&prime;-sab.&rdquo;
The clay is carefully macerated between the fingers until it is soft
and fine. It is then roughly shaped by the fingers, and afterwards,
when partially hardened, is finished with a set of five light, wooden
tools.</p>
<p>The finished bowls are in three different colors. When baked about
nine hours the pipes come forth gray. Those coming out red have been
burned about twelve hours, usually all night. The black ones are made
by reburning the red bowls about half an hour in palay straw.</p>
<p>Two men in Sabangan and one each in Genugan and Takong&mdash;all
western pueblos&mdash;manufacture metal &ldquo;anito&rdquo; pipes.
To-day brass wire and the metal of cartridge shells are most commonly
employed in making these pipes.</p>
<p>The process of manufacture is elaborate and very interesting. First
a beeswax model is made the exact size and shape of the finished metal
pipe. All beeswax, called &ldquo;a-t&#301;d&prime;,&rdquo; used in pipe
making comes from Barlig through Kanu, and the illustration (<a href=
"#pl108">Pl. CVIII</a>) shows the form in which it passes in commerce
in the area. A small amount of wax is softened by a fire until it can
be flattened in the palm of the hand. It is then rolled around a stick
the size of the bore in the bowl. The outside of the wax bowl is next
designed as is shown in the illustration (<a href="#pl108">Pl.
CVIII</a>). A careful examination of the illustration will show that
the design represents the sitting figure of a man. He is resting his
elbows on his knees and holding his lower jaw in his hands&mdash;eyes,
ears, nose, mouth, and fingers are all represented. This design is made
in the wax with a small knife. The wax for the short stem piece is
flattened and folded around a stick the size of the bore of the stem.
The stem piece is then set into the bowl and the design which was
started on the bowl is continued over the stem.</p>
<p>When the wax pipe is completed a projecting point of wax is attached
to the base of the pipe, and the whole is imbedded in a clay jacket,
the point of wax, however, projecting from the jacket. The clay used by
the pipe maker is obtained in a pit at Pingad in the vicinity of
Genugan. Around the wax point a clay funnel is built. The clay mold,
called &ldquo;bang-bang&prime;-a,&rdquo; is thoroughly baked by a fire.
In less than an hour the mold is hardened and brown, and the wax pipe
within it has melted and the wax been poured out of the mold through
the gate or opening left by the melting point of wax, leaving the mold
empty.</p>
<p>A small Malayan bellows, called &ldquo;op-op&prime;,&rdquo; the
exact duplicate in miniature of the double tubular bellows described in
the preceding section on &ldquo;metal weapons,&rdquo; furnishes the
draught for a small charcoal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5494"
href="#xd21e5494" name="xd21e5494">132</a>]</span>fire. The funnel of
the clay mold is filled with pieces of metal, and the entire thing is
buried in the fired charcoal. In fifteen minutes the metal melts and
runs down through the gate at the bottom of the funnel into the hollow,
wax-lined mold. Since the entire mold is hot, the metal does not cool
or harden promptly, and the pipe maker taps and jars the mold in order
to make the metal penetrate and fill every part.</p>
<p>The mold is set aside to cool and is then broken away from the metal
core. To-day the pipe maker possesses a file with which to smooth and
clean the crude pipe. Formerly all that labor, and it is extensive, was
performed with stones.</p>
<p>It requires two men to make the &ldquo;anito&rdquo;
pipes&mdash;t&#301;n-ak-ta&prime;-go. One superintends all the work and
performs the finest of it, and the second pumps the bellows and smooths
and cleans the pipe after it is cast. The two men make four pipes per
day, but the purchaser of an &ldquo;anito&rdquo; pipe puts days of toil
on the metal, smoothing and perfecting it by cleaning and digging out
the design until it becomes really a beautiful bit of primitive
art.</p>
<p>When a pueblo wants a few t&#301;n-ak-ta&prime;-go it sends for the
manufacturer, and he comes to the pueblo with his helper and remains as
long as necessary. Ay-o&prime;-na, of Genugan, annually visits Titipan,
Ankiling, Sagada, Bontoc, and Samoki. He usually furnishes all
material, and receives a peseta for each pipe, but the pueblo furnishes
the food. In this way a pipe maker is a journeyman about half the
year.</p>
<p>Tukukan makes a smooth, cast-metal pipe, called
&ldquo;p&#301;n-e-po-yong&prime;,&rdquo; and Baliwang makes tubular
iron pipes at her smithies. They are hammered out and pounded and
welded over a core. I have seen several of such excellent workmanship
that the welded seam could not be detected on the surface.</p>
<p>In the western part of the area both men and women smoke, and some
smoke almost constantly. Throughout the areas occupied by Christians
children of 6 or 7 years smoke a great deal. I have repeatedly seen
girls not over 6 years of age smoking rolls of tobacco,
&ldquo;cigars,&rdquo; <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">a
foot</span> long and more than <span class="measure" title=
"25 millimeters">an inch</span> in diameter, but in Bontoc area small
children do not smoke. In most of the area women do not smoke at all,
and boys seldom smoke until they reach maturity.</p>
<p>In Bontoc the tobacco leaf for smoking is rolled up and pinched off
in small sections <span class="measure" title="25 millimeters">an
inch</span> or so in length. These pieces are then wrapped in a larger
section of leaf. When finished for the pipe the tobacco resembles a
short stub of a cigar. Only half a dozen whiffs are generally taken at
a smoke, and the pipe with its tobacco is then tucked under the edge of

man&rsquo;s hat show that the owners stopped smoking long before they
exhausted their pipes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5518" href=

<h5 class="main">Fire making</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The oldest instrument for fire making used by the
Bontoc Igorot is now seldom found. However, practically all boys of a
dozen years know how to make and use it.</p>
<p>It is called &ldquo;co-li&prime;-li,&rdquo; and is a friction
machine made of two pieces of dry bamboo. A <span class="measure"
title="60-centimeter">2-foot</span> section of dead and dry bamboo is
split lengthwise and in one piece a small area of the stringy tissue
lining the tube is splintered and picked quite loose. Immediately over
this, on the outside of the tube, a narrow groove is cut at right
angles to it. This piece of bamboo becomes the stationary lower part of
the fire machine. One edge of the other half of the original tube is
sharpened like a chisel blade. This section is grasped in both hands,
one at each end, and is at first slowly and heavily, afterwards more
rapidly, drawn back and forth through the groove of the stationary
bamboo, making a small conical pile of dry dust beneath the
opening.</p>
<p>After a dozen strokes the sides of the groove and the edge of the
friction piece burn brown, presently a smell of smoke is plain, and
before three dozen strokes have been made smoke may be seen. Usually
before one hundred strokes a larger volume of smoke tells that the dry
dust constantly falling on the pile has grown more and more charred
until finally a tiny friction-fired particle falls, carrying combustion
to the already heated dust cone.</p>
<p>The machine is carefully raised, and, if the fire is permanently
kindled, the pinch of smoldering dust is inserted in a wisp of dry
grass or other easily inflammable material; in a minute or two flames
burst forth, and the fire may be transferred where desired.</p>
<p>The pal-t&#301;ng&prime;, the world-wide flint and steel-percussion
fire machine, is found with all Bontoc men.</p>
<p>At Sagada there is a ledge of exposed and crumbling rock from which
most of the men of the western part of the Bontoc culture area obtain
their &ldquo;flint.&rdquo; The &ldquo;steel&rdquo; is any piece of iron
which may be had&mdash;probably a part of the ferrule from the butt of
a spear shaft is used more than is any other one kind of iron.</p>
<p>The pal-t&#301;ng&prime; is secured either in a very small basket or
a leather roll which is fastened closed by a string. In this receptacle
a small amount of dry tree cotton is also carried. The
pal-t&#301;ng&prime; receptacle is carried about in the large bag
hanging at the girdle.</p>
<p>Fire is made by a tiny percussion-heated particle of the stone as it
flies away under the sharp, glancing blow of the &ldquo;steel&rdquo;
and catches in the dry cotton held by the thumb nail on the upper
surface of the stone.</p>
<p>If the fire maker wishes to light his pipe, he tucks the smoldering
cotton lightly into his roll of tobacco; a few draws are sufficient to
ignite the pipeful. If an out-of-door fire is desired the cotton is
first used to ignite a dry bunch of grass. Should the fire be needed in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5543" href="#xd21e5543" name=
"xd21e5543">134</a>]</span>dwelling, the cotton is placed on charcoal.
Blowing and care will produce a good, blazing wood fire in a few
minutes.</p>
<p>To-day friction matches are known throughout the area, although
probably not one person in one hundred has ever owned a box of
matches.</p>
<p>The fire syringe, common west of Bontoc Province among the Tinguian,
is not known in the Bontoc culture area.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Division of labor</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under this title must be grouped all forms of
occupations which are considered necessary to the life of the
pueblo.</p>
<p>Up to the age of 5 or 6 years Bontoc children do not work. As has
been said in a previous chapter, during the months of April and May
many little girls from 5 to 10 work and play together for long hours
daily gathering a few varieties of wild plants close about the pueblo
for food for the pigs. This labor is unnecessary as soon as the camote
vines become large enough for gathering. During June and July these
same girls gather the camote vines for pig food. About August this
labor falls to the women.</p>
<p>Mention has also been made of the fact that during the latter half
of April and May the boys and girls of all ages from 6 or 7 years to 13
or 14 guard the palay sementeras against the birds from earliest dawn
till heavy twilight.</p>
<p>Little girls often help about the dwelling by paring camotes for the
forthcoming meal.</p>
<p>At all times the elder children, both boys and girls, are baby
tenders while their parents work.</p>
<p>Man is the sole hunter and warrior, and he alone fishes when traps
or snares are employed.</p>
<p>Only men go to the mountains to cut and bring home firewood and
lumber for building purposes; widowed women sometimes bring home dead
fallen wood found along the trails. Only men construct the various
private and public buildings. They alone build the stone dikes of the
sementeras and construct the irrigating ditches and dams; they
transport to the pueblo most of the harvested palay. They manufacture
and vend basi, and prepare the salted meats. They make all weapons, and
all implements and utensils for field and household labors. Contrary to
a widespread custom among primitive people, as has been noted, the
Igorot man constructs all basket work, whether hats, baskets, trays, or
ornaments, and bindings of weapons and implements. Men are the workers
of all metal and stone. They are the only cargadors, though in the
Kiapa area of Benguet Province women sometimes go on the trails as paid
burden bearers for Americans.</p>
<p>Only men are said to tattoo and circumcise. They determine the days
of rest and of ceremony for the pueblo, and all pueblo ceremonies are
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5572" href="#xd21e5572" name=
"xd21e5572">135</a>]</span>their hands; so also are the ceremonies of
the ato&mdash;only men are &ldquo;priests,&rdquo; except for private
household ceremonials.</p>
<p>Men constitute the &ldquo;control element&rdquo; of the pueblo. They
are the legislative, executive, and judicial power for the pueblo and
each ato; they are considered the wisdom of their people, and they
alone, it is said, give public advice on important matters.</p>
<p>The woman is the only weaver of fabrics and the only spinner of the
materials of which the fabrics are made. On the west coast the Ilokano
men do a great deal of the spinning, but the Igorot man has not
imitated them in the industry, though he has often seen them. Women are
the sole potters of Samoki, and they alone transport and vend their
wares to other pueblos. In the Mayinit salt industry only the woman
tends the salt house, gathering the crude salt solution.</p>
<p>Only the women plant the rice seed, and they alone transplant the
palay; they also care for the growing plants and harvest most of the
crops. In the transplanting and harvesting of palay the woman is given
credit for greater dexterity than the man; men harvest palay only when
sufficient women can not be found. Women plant, care for, harvest, and
transport to the pueblo all camotes, millet, maize, and beans.</p>
<p>The men and women together construct and repair irrigated
sementeras, men usually digging the earth while the women transport it.
Together they prepare the soil of irrigated sementeras, and carry
manure to them from the pigpens. Men at times do the women&rsquo;s work
in harvesting, and women sometimes assist the men to carry the harvest
to the pueblo. Either threshes out and hulls the rice, though the woman
does more than half this work. Both prepare foods for cooking, cook the
meals, and serve them. Both bring water from the river for household
uses, though the woman brings the greater part. Each tends the babe
while the other works in the field. Both care for the chickens and
pigs, even to cooking the food for the latter. Men and women catch fish
by hand in the river, manufacture tapui, and in the salt industry both
evaporate the salt solution and vend the salt.</p>
<p>In the treatment of the sick and the driving out of afflicting
anito, men and women alike serve.</p>
<p>Little work is demanded of the old people, though the labors they
perform are of great value to the pueblo, as the strong are thus given
more time for a vigorous industrial life.</p>
<p>Great service is rendered the pueblo by the councils of the old men,
and they are the &ldquo;priests&rdquo; of all ceremonials, except those
of the household.</p>
<p>The old men do practically nothing at manual labor in the field.
However, numbers of old men and women guard the palay sementeras from
the birds, and they frequently tend their grandchildren about the
pueblo. They also bring water from the river to the dwelling.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5591" href="#xd21e5591" name=
"xd21e5591">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>Old women seem generally busy. They prepare and cook foods, and they
spin materials for women&rsquo;s skirts and girdles. The blind women
share in these labors, even going to the river for water.</p>
<p>By labor of the group is meant the common effort of two or more
people whose everyday possessions and accumulations are not in common,
as they are in a family, to perform some definite labor which can be
better done by such effort than by the separate labors of the several
members of the group.</p>
<p>A pueblo war probably represents the largest necessary
group-occupation, because at such time all available warriors unite in
a concerted effort. Next to this, though possibly coming before it, is
the group assembled for the erection of a dwelling. As has been noted,
all dwellings are built by a group, and when a rich man&rsquo;s
domicile is to be put up a great many people assemble&mdash;the men to
erect the dwelling, and the women to prepare and cook the food. A great
deal of agricultural labor is performed by the group. New irrigation
ditches are built by, or at the instance of, all those who will benefit
by them. The dam built annually across the river at Bontoc pueblo is
constructed by all, or at the instance of all, who benefit from the
additional irrigation water. Wild carabaos are hunted by a group of
men, and the domestic carabaos can be caught only when several men
surround and attack them.</p>
<p>All interpueblo commerce is carried on by a group of people. Almost
never does a person pass from one pueblo to another alone, and commerce
is the chief thing which causes the interpueblo communication. These
groups of traveling merchants consist of from two or three persons to a
dozen or more&mdash;as in the case of the Samoki pottery sellers.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e5600">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Wages, and exchange of labor</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The woman receives the same wage as the man. There are
two reasons why she should. First, all labor is by the day, so the
facts of sickness and maternity never keep the woman from her labor
when she is expected and is depended on; and, second, she is as
efficient in the labors she performs as is the man&mdash;in some she is
recognized <span class="corr" title="Not in source">as</span> more
efficient. She does as much work as <span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">a</span> man, and does it as well or better. It is
worth so much to have a certain work done in a particular time, and the
Igorot pays the wage to whomever does the work. The growing boy or girl
who performs the same labors as an adult receives an equal wage.</p>
<p>Not only do the people work by the day, but they are paid daily
also. Every night the laborer goes to the dwelling of his employer and
receives the wage; the wages of unmarried children are paid to their
parents.</p>
<p>To all classes of laborers dinner and sometimes supper is supplied.
For weeding and thinning the sementeras of young palay and for watching
the fruiting palay to drive away the birds, the only wage is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5615" href="#xd21e5615" name=
"xd21e5615">137</a>]</span>these two meals. But this labor is light,
and frightening away the birds is usually the work of children or very
old people who can not perform hard labors. In all classes of work for
which only food is given, much time is left to the laborers in which
the men may weave their basket work and the women spin the bark-fiber
thread for skirts.</p>
<p>Five manojos of palay is the daily wage for all laborers except
those mentioned in the last paragraph. This is the wage of the wood
gatherer in the mountains, of the builder of granaries, sementeras,
irrigating ditches, and dikes, and of those who prepare soils and who
plant and harvest crops.</p>
<p>There is much exchange of labor between individuals, and even
between large groups of people, such as members of an ato. Formerly
exchange of labor was practiced slightly more than at present, but
to-day, as has been noted, all dwellings are built by the unpaid labor
of those who come for the accompanying feast and &ldquo;good
time,&rdquo; and because their own dwellings were or will be built by
such labor. A great deal of agricultural labor is now paid for in kind;
practically all the available labor in an ato turns out to help a
member when a piece of work is urgent. However, it is not customary for
poor people to exchange their labor, since they constantly need food
for those dependent on them. When the poor man desires a wage for his
toil he needs only to tell some rich person that he wishes to work for
him&mdash;both understand that a wage will be paid.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Distribution</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By the term &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; is here meant
the ordinary division of the productions of Bontoc area among the
several classes of Igorot in the area&mdash;in other words, what is
each person&rsquo;s share of that which the area produces?</p>
<p>It must be said that distribution is very equitable. Wages are
uniform. No man or set of men habitually spoils another&rsquo;s
accumulations by exacting from him a tax or &ldquo;rake off.&rdquo;
There is no form of gambling or winning another&rsquo;s earnings. There
are no slaves or others who labor without wages; children do not retain
their own wages until they marry, but they inherit all their
parents&rsquo; possessions. There is almost no usury. There is no
indigent class, and the rich men toil as industriously in the fields as
do the poor&mdash;though I must say I never knew a rich man to go as
cargador on the trail.</p>

<h4 class="main">Theft</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Higher forms of society, even such society as the
Christianized Filipinos of the coastal cities, produce and possess a
considerable number of people who live and often raise families on
personal property stolen and carried away from the lawful owners.
Almost no thief in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5633" href=
"#xd21e5633" name="xd21e5633">137</a>]</span>the Bontoc area escapes
detection&mdash;the society is too simple for him to escape&mdash;and
when he is apprehended he restores more than he took away. There is no
opportunity for a thief class to develop, consequently there is no
chance for theft to distort the usual equitable division of
products.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e5635">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Conquest</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Conquest, or the act of gaining control and
acquisition of another&rsquo;s property by force of arms, is not
operative in the Bontoc area. Moro and perhaps other southern Malayan
people frequently capture people by conquest whom they enslave, and
they also bring back much valuable loot in the shape of metals and the
much-prized large earthen jars.</p>
<p>Certain Igorot, as those of Asin, make forcible conquests on their
neighbors and carry away persons for slavery. Asin made a raid westward
into Suyak of Lepanto Province in 1900, and some American miners joined
the expedition of natives to try to recover the captives. But Bontoc
has no such conquests, and, since the people have long ago ceased
migration, there is no conquest of territory. In their interpueblo
warfare loot is seldom carried away. There is practically nothing in
the form of movable and easily controlled valuable possessions, such as
domestic cattle, horses, or carabaos, so the usual equilibrium of
Bontoc property distribution has little to disturb it.</p>
<p>The primitive agriculturist is thought of in history as the victim
of warlike neighbors who make predatory forays against him, repeatedly
robbing him of his hard-earned accumulations. In Igorot land this is
not the case. There are no savage or barbaric people, except the
Negritos who are not agriculturists. Sometimes, however, some of the
Igorot groups descend to the settlements of the Christians in the
lowlands and in the night bring back a few carabaos and hogs. The
Igorot of Quiangan are noted for such robberies made on the pueblos of
Bagabag and Ibung to the south in central Nueva Vizcaya. Sometimes,
also, one Igorot group speaks of another as Busol, or enemy, and says
the Busol come to rob them in the night. I believe, however, from
inquiries made, that relatively very small amounts of property pass
from one Igorot group to another by robbery or conquest.</p>
<p>The Bontoc Igorot appears to be in a transition stage, not usually
emphasized, between the communism of the savage or barbarian in which
each person is said to have a share as long as necessities last, and
the more advanced forms of society in which many classes are able to
divert to their own advantage much which otherwise would not come to
them. The Igorot is not a communist, neither in any sense does he get
the monopolist&rsquo;s share. He is living a life of such natural
production that he enjoys the fruits of his labors in a fairer way than
do many of the men beneath him or above him in culture. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Consumption</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under this title will be considered simply the foods
and beverages of the people. No attempt will be made to treat of
consumption in its breadth as it appears to the economist.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e5652">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Foods</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are few forms of animal life about the Igorot
that he will not and does not eat. The exceptions are mainly
insectivora, and such larger animals as the mythology of the Igorot
says were once men&mdash;as the monkey, serpent-eagle, crow, snake,
etc. However, he is not wholly lacking in taste and preference in his
foods. Of his common vegetable foods he frequently said he prefers,
first, beans; second, rice; third, maize; fourth, camotes; fifth,
millet.</p>
<p>Rice is the staple food, and most families have sufficient for
subsistence during the year. When rice is needed for food bunches of
the palay, as tied up at the harvest, are brought and laid in the small
pocket of the wooden mortar where they are threshed out of the fruit
head. One or two mortarsful is thus threshed and put aside on a
winnowing tray. When sufficient has been obtained the grain is put
again in the mortar and pounded to remove the pellicle. Usually only
sufficient rice is threshed and cleaned for the consumption of one or
two days. When the pellicle has been pounded loose the grain is
winnowed on a large round tray by a series of dexterous movements,
removing all chaff and dirt with scarcely the loss of a kernel of good
rice.</p>
<p>The work of threshing, hulling, and winnowing usually falls to the
women and girls, but is sometimes performed by the men when their women
are preoccupied. At one time when an American wished two or three
bushels of palay threshed, as horse food for the trail, three Bontoc
men performed the work in the classic treadmill manner. They spread a
mat on the earth, covered it with palay, and then tread, or rather
&ldquo;rubbed,&rdquo; out the kernels with their bare feet. They often
scraped up the mass with their feet, bunching it and rubbing it in a
way that strongly suggested hands.</p>
<p>Rice is cooked in water without salt. An earthern pot is half filled
with the grain and is then filled to the brim with cold water. In about
twenty minutes the rice is cooked, filling the vessel, and the water is
all absorbed or evaporated. If there is no great haste, the rice sets
ten or fifteen minutes longer while the kernels dry out somewhat. As
the Igorot cooks rice, or, for that matter, as the native anywhere in
the Islands cooks it, the grains are not mashed and mussed together,
but each kernel remains whole and separate from the others.</p>
<p>Cooked rice, ma-kan&prime;, is almost always eaten with the fingers,
being crowded into the mouth with the back of the thumb. In Bontoc,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5665" href="#xd21e5665" name=
"xd21e5665">140</a>]</span>Samoki, Titipan, Mayinit, and Ganang salt is
either sprinkled on the rice after it is dished out or is tasted from
the finger tips during the eating. In some pueblos, as at Tulubin,
almost no salt is eaten at any time. When rice alone is eaten at a meal
a family of five adults eats about ten Bontoc manojo of rice per
day.</p>
<p>Beans are cooked in the form of a thick soup, but without salt.
Beans and rice, each cooked separately, are frequently eaten together;
such a dish is called &ldquo;s&#301;b-fan&prime;.&rdquo; Salt is eaten
with s&#301;b-fan&prime; by those pueblos which commonly consume
salt.</p>
<p>Maize is husked, silked, and then cooked on the cob. It is eaten
from the cob, and no salt is used either in the cooking or eating.</p>
<p>Camotes are eaten raw a great deal about the pueblo, the sementera,
and the trail. Before they are cooked they are pared and generally cut
in pieces about <span class="measure" title="5 centimeters">2
inches</span> long; they are boiled without salt. They are eaten alone
at many meals, but are relished best when eaten with rice. They are
always eaten from the fingers.</p>
<p>One dish, called &ldquo;ke-le&prime;-ke,&rdquo; consists of camotes,
pared and sliced, and cooked and eaten with rice. This is a ceremonial
dish, and is always prepared at the lis-lis ceremony and at
a-su-fal&prime;-i-wis or sugar-making time.</p>
<p>Camotes are always prepared immediately before being cooked, as they
blacken very quickly after paring.</p>
<p>Millet is stored in the harvest bunches, and must be threshed before
it is eaten. After being threshed in the wooden mortar the winnowed
seeds are again returned to the mortar and crushed. This crushed grain
is cooked as is rice and without salt. It is eaten also with the
hands&mdash;&ldquo;fingers&rdquo; is too delicate a term.</p>
<p>Some other vegetable foods are also cooked and eaten by the Igorot.
Among them is taro which, however, is seldom grown in the Bontoc area.
Outside the area, both north and south, there are large sementeras of
it cultivated for food. Several wild plants are also gathered, and the
leaves cooked and eaten as the American eats &ldquo;greens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bontoc Igorot also has preferences among his regular flesh
foods. The chicken is prized most; next he favors pork; third, fish;
fourth, carabao; and fifth, dog. Chicken, pork (except wild hog), and
dog are never eaten except ceremonially. Fish and carabao are eaten on
ceremonial occasions, but are also eaten at other times&mdash;merely as
food.</p>
<p>The interesting ceremonial killing, dressing, and eating of chickens
is presented elsewhere, in the sections on &ldquo;Death&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ceremonials.&rdquo; It is unnecessary to repeat the information
here, as the processes are everywhere the same, excepting that
generally no part of the fowl, except the feathers, is
unconsumed&mdash;head, feet, intestines, everything, is devoured.</p>
<p>The hog is ceremonially killed by cutting its throat, not by
&ldquo;sticking,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5691" href=
"#xd21e5691" name="xd21e5691">141</a>]</span>as is the American custom,
but the neck is cut, half severing the head. At Ambuklao, on the Agno
River in Benguet Province, I saw a hog ceremonially killed by having a
round-pointed stick <span class="measure" title="25 millimeters">an
inch</span> in diameter pushed and twisted into it from the right side
behind the foreleg, through and between the ribs, and into the heart.
The animal bled internally, and, while it was being cut up by four men
with much ceremony and show, the blood was scooped from the rib basin
where it had gathered, and was mixed with the animal&rsquo;s brains.
The intestines were then emptied by drawing between thumb and fingers,
and the blood and brain mixture poured into them from the stomach as a
funnel. A string of blood-and-brain sausages resulted, when the
intestines were cooked. The mouth of the Bontoc hog is held or tied
shut until the animal is dead. The Benguet hog could be heard for
fifteen minutes at least <span class="measure" title="400 meters">a
quarter of a mile</span>.</p>
<p>After the Bontoc hog is killed it is singed, cut up, and all put in
the large shallow iron boiler. When cooked it is cut into smaller
pieces, which are passed around to those assembled at the
ceremonial.</p>
<p>Fish are eaten both ceremonially and privately whenever they may be
obtained. The small fish, the kacho, are in no way cleaned or dressed.
Two or three times I saw them cooked and eaten ceremonially, and was
told they are prepared the same way for private consumption. The fish,
scarcely any over <span class="measure" title="5 centimeters">2
inches</span> in length, were strung on twisted green-grass strings
about <span class="measure" title="15 centimeters">6 inches</span> in
length. Several of these strings were tied together and placed in an
olla of water. When cooked they were lifted out, the strings broken
apart, and the fish stripped off into a wooden bowl. Salt was then
liberally strewn over them. A large green leaf was brought as a plate
for each person present, and the fish were divided again and again
until each had an equal share. However, the old men present received
double share, and were served before the others. At one time a man was
present with a nursing babe in his arms, and he was given two leaves,
or two shares, though no one expected the babe could eat its share.
After the fish food was passed to each, the broth was also liberally
salted and then poured into several wooden bowls. At one fish feast
platters of cooked rice and squash were also brought and set among the
people. Handful after handful of solid food followed its predecessor
rapidly to the always-crammed mouth. The fish was eaten as one might
eat sparingly of a delicacy, and the broth was drunk now and then
between mouthfuls.</p>
<p>Two other fish are also eaten by the Igorot of the area, the liling,
about <span class="measure" title="10 to 15 centimeters">4 to 6
inches</span> in length&mdash;also cooked and eaten without
dressing&mdash;and the chalit, a large fish said to acquire the length
of <span class="measure" title="120 centimeters">4 feet</span>.</p>
<p>Several small animals, crustaceans and mollusks, gathered in the
river and picked up in the sementeras by the women, are cooked and
eaten. All these are considered similar to fish and are eaten
similarly. Among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5719" href=
"#xd21e5719" name="xd21e5719">142</a>]</span>these is a bright-red crab
called &ldquo;agkama.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5721src" href=
"#xd21e5721" name="xd21e5721src">8</a> This is boiled and all eaten
except part of the back shell and the hard &ldquo;pinchers.&rdquo; A
shrimp-like crustacean obtained in the irrigated sementeras is also
boiled and eaten entire. A few mollusks are eaten after being cooked.
One, called kitan, I have seen eaten many times; it is a snail-like
animal, and after being boiled it is sucked into the mouth after the
apex of the shell has been bitten or broken off. Two other animals said
to be somewhat similar are called finga and lischug.</p>
<p>The carabao is killed by spearing and, though also eaten simply as
food, it is seldom killed except on ceremonial occasions, such as
marriages, funerals, the building of a dwelling, and peace and war
feasts whether actual events at the time or feasts in
commemoration.</p>
<p>The chief occasion for eating carabao merely as a food is when an
animal is injured or ill at a time when no ceremonial event is at hand.
The animal is then killed and eaten. All is eaten that can be
masticated. The animal is neither skinned, singed, nor scraped. All is
cut up and cooked together&mdash;hide, hair, hoofs, intestines, and
head, excepting the horns. Carabao is generally not salted in cooking,
and the use of salt in eating the flesh depends on the individual
eater.</p>
<p>Sometimes large pieces of raw carabao meat are laid on high racks
near the dwelling and &ldquo;dried&rdquo; in the sun. There are several
such racks in Bontoc, and one can know a long distance from them
whether they hold &ldquo;dried&rdquo; meat. If one pueblo, in the area
exceeds another in the strength and unpleasantness of its
&ldquo;dried&rdquo; meat it is Mayinit, where on the occasion of a
visit there a very small piece of meat jammed on a stick-like a
&ldquo;taffy stick&rdquo;&mdash;and joyfully sucked by a 2-year-old
babe successfully bombarded and depopulated our camp.</p>
<p>Various meats, called &ldquo;&#301;t-tag&prime;,&rdquo; as carabao
and pork, are &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; by salting down in large
bejuco-bound gourds, called &ldquo;fa&prime;-lay,&rdquo; or in tightly
covered ollas, called &ldquo;tu-u&prime;-nan.&rdquo; All pueblos in the
area (except Ambawan, which has an unexplained taboo against eating
carabao) thus store away meats, but Bitwagan, Sadanga, and Tukukan
habitually salt large quantities in the fa&prime;-lay. Meats are kept
thus two or three years, though of course the odor is vile.</p>
<p>The dog ranks last in the list of regular flesh foods of the Bontoc
man. In the Benguet area it ranks second, pork receiving the first
place. The Ibilao does not eat dog&mdash;his dog is a hunter and guard,
giving alarm of the approaching enemy.</p>
<p>In Bontoc the dog is eaten only on ceremonial occasions. Funerals
and marriages are probably more often celebrated by a dog feast than
are any other of their ceremonials. The animal&rsquo;s mouth is held
closed and his legs secured while he is killed by cutting the throat.
Then his tail is cut off close to the body&mdash;why, I could not
learn, but I once saw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5749" href=
"#xd21e5749" name="xd21e5749">143</a>]</span>it, and am told it always
is so. The animal is singed in the fire and the crisped hair rubbed off
with sticks and hands, after which it is cut up and boiled, and then
further cut up and eaten as is the carabao meat.</p>
<p>Young babies are sometimes fed hard-boiled fresh eggs, but the
Igorot otherwise does not eat &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; eggs, though he does
eat large numbers of stale ones. He prefers to wait, as one of them
said, &ldquo;until there is something in the egg to eat.&rdquo; He
invariably brings stale or developing eggs to the American until he is
told to bring fresh ones. It is not alone the Igorot who has this
peculiar preference&mdash;the same condition exists widespread in the
Archipelago.</p>
<p>Locusts, or cho&prime;-chon, are gathered, cooked, and eaten by the
Igorot, as by all other natives in the Islands. They are greatly
relished, but may be had in Bontoc only irregularly&mdash;perhaps once
or twice for a week or ten days each year, or once in two years. They
are cooked in boiling water and later dried, whereupon they become
crisp and sweet. By some Igorot they are stored away, but I can not say
whether they are kept in Bontoc any considerable time after
cooking.</p>
<p>The locusts come in storms, literally like a pelting, large-flaked
snowstorm, driving across the country for hours and even days at a
time. All Igorot have large scoop nets for catching them and immense
bottle-like baskets in which to put them and transport them home. The
locust catcher runs along in the storm, and, whirling around in it with
his large net, scoops in the victims. Many families sometimes wander a
week or more catching locusts when they come to their vicinity, and
cease only when <span class="measure" title=
"several kilometers">miles</span> from home. The cry of
&ldquo;enemy&rdquo; will scarcely set an Igorot community astir sooner
than will the cry of &ldquo;cho&prime;-chon.&rdquo; The locust is
looked upon by them as a very manna from heaven. Pi-na-lat&prime; is a
food of cooked locusts pounded and mixed with uncooked rice. All is
salted down in an olla and tightly covered over with a vegetable leaf
or a piece of cloth. When it is eaten the mixture is cooked, though
this cooking does not kill the strong odor of decay.</p>
<p>Other insect foods are also eaten. I once saw a number of men
industriously robbing the large white &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; from an ant
nest in a tree. The nest was built of leaves attached by a web. Into
the bottom of this closed pocket the men poked a hole with a long
stick, letting <span class="measure" title="half a liter">a pint</span>
or more of the white pupae run out on a winnowing tray on the earth.
From this tray the furious ants were at length driven, and the eggs
taken home for cooking.</p>

<h4 class="main">Beverages</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot drinks water much more than any other
beverage. On the trail, though carrying loads while the American may
walk empty handed, he drinks less than the American. He seldom drinks
while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5770" href="#xd21e5770" name=
"xd21e5770">144</a>]</span>eating, though he makes a beverage said to
be drunk only at mealtime. After meals he usually drinks water
copiously.</p>
<p>B&aacute;-si is the Igorot name of the fermented beverage prepared
from sugar cane. &ldquo;B&aacute;-si,&rdquo; under various names, is
found widespread throughout the Islands. The Bontoc man makes his
b&aacute;-si in December. He boils the expressed juice of the sugar
cane about six hours, at which time he puts into it a handful of
vegetable ferment obtained from a tree called
&ldquo;tub-f&#301;g&prime;.&rdquo; This vegetable ferment is gathered
from the tree as a flower or young fruit; it is dried and stored in the
dwelling for future use. The brewed liquid is poured into a large olla,
the flat-bottom variety called &ldquo;fu-o-foy&prime;&rdquo;
manufactured expressly for b&aacute;-si, and then is tightly covered
over and set away in the granary. In five days the ferment has worked
sufficiently, and the beverage may be drunk. It remains good about four
months, for during the fifth or sixth month it turns very acid.</p>
<p>B&aacute;-si is manufactured by the men alone. Tukukan and Titipan
manufacture it to sell to other pueblos; it is sold for about
<span class="measure" title="15 centavos per liter">half a peso per
gallon</span>. It is drunk quite a good deal during the year, though
mostly on ceremonial occasions. Men frequently carry a small amount of
it with them to the sementeras when they guard them against the wild
hogs during the long nights. They say it helps to keep them warm. One
glass of b&aacute;-si will intoxicate a person not accustomed to drink
it, though the Igorot who uses it habitually may drink two or three
glasses before intoxication. Usually a man drinks only a few swallows
of it at a time, and I never saw an Igorot intoxicated except during
some ceremony and then not more than a dozen in several months. Women
never drink b&aacute;-si.</p>
<p>Ta-p&uacute;-i is a fermented drink made from rice, the
cha-y&#277;t&prime;-&#301;t variety, they say, grown in Bontoc pueblo.
It is a very sweet and sticky rice when cooked. This beverage also is
found practically everywhere in the Archipelago. Only a small amount of
the cha-y&#277;t&prime;-&#301;t is grown by Bontoc pueblo. To
manufacture ta-p&uacute;-i the rice is cooked and then spread on a
winnowing tray until it is cold. When cold <span class="measure" title=
"about 100 grams">a few ounces</span> of a ferment called
&ldquo;fu-fud&rdquo; are sprinkled over it and thoroughly stirred in;
all is then put in an olla, which is tied over and set away. The
ferment consists of cane sugar and dry raw rice pounded and pulverized
together to a fine powder. This is then spread in the sun to dry and is
later squeezed into small balls some <span class="measure" title=
"5 centimeters">2 inches</span> in diameter. This ferment will keep a
year. When needed a ball is pulverized and sprinkled fine over the
cooked rice. An olla of rice prepared for ta-p&uacute;-i will be found
in one day half filled with the beverage.</p>
<p>Ta-p&uacute;-i will keep only about two months. It is never drunk by
the women, though they do eat the sweet rice kernels from the jar, and
they, as well as the men, manufacture it. It is claimed never to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5789" href="#xd21e5789" name=
"xd21e5789">145</a>]</span>manufactured in the Bontoc area for sale. A
half glass of the beverage will intoxicate. At the end of a month the
beverage is very intoxicating, and is then commonly weakened with
water. Ta-p&uacute;-i is much preferred to b&aacute;-si.</p>
<p>The Bontoc man prepares another drink which is filthy, and, even
they themselves say, vile smelling. It is called
&ldquo;sa-fu-&#277;ng&prime;,&rdquo; is drunk at meals, and is prepared
as follows: Cold water is first put in a jar, and into it are thrown
cooked rice, cooked camotes, cooked locusts, and all sorts of cooked
flesh and bones. The resulting liquid is drunk at the end of ten days,
and is sour and vinegar-like. The preparation is perpetuated by adding
more water and solid ingredients&mdash;it does not matter much what
they are.</p>
<p>The odor of sa-fu-&#277;ng&prime; is the worst stench in Bontoc. I
never closely investigated the beverage personally&mdash;but I have no
reason to doubt what the Igorot says of it; but if all is true, why is
it not fatal?</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e5795">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Salt</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Throughout the year the pueblo of Mayinit produces
salt from a number of brackish hot springs occupying about <span class=
"measure" title="4,000 square meters">an acre</span> of ground at the
north end of the pueblo.</p>
<p>Mayinit has a population of about 1,000 souls, probably half of whom
are directly interested in salt production. It is probable that the
pueblo owes its location to the salt springs, although adjoining it to
the south is an arable valley now filled with rice sementeras, which
may first have drawn the people.</p>
<p>The hot springs slowly raise their water to the surface, where it
flows along in shallow streams. Over these streams, or rather sheets of
sluggish water, the Igorot have built 152 salt houses, usually about
<span class="measure" title="3&frac12; meters">12 feet</span> wide and
from <span class="measure" title="3&frac12; to 7&frac12; meters">12 to
25 feet</span> long. The houses, well shown in <a href="#pl115">Pl.
CXV</a>, are simply grass-covered roofs extending to the earth.</p>
<p>There is no ownership in the springs to-day&mdash;just as there is
no ownership in springs which furnish irrigating water&mdash;one owns
the water that passes into his salt house, but has no claim on that
which passes through it and flows out below. So each person has
ownership of all and only all the water he can use within his plant,
and the people claim there are no disputes between owners of
houses&mdash;as they look at it, each owner of a salt house has an
equal chance to gather salt.</p>
<p>The ground space of the salt house is closely paved with
cobblestones from <span class="measure" title="10 to 15 centimeters">4
to 6 inches</span> in diameter. The water passes among the bases of
these stones, and the salt is deposited in a thin crust over their
surface. (See <a href="#pl116">Pl. CXVI</a>.)</p>
<p>These houses are inherited, and, as a consequence, several persons
may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5828" href="#xd21e5828" name=
"xd21e5828">146</a>]</span>ultimately have proprietary interest in one
house. In such a case the ground space is divided, often resulting in
many twig-separated patches, as is shown in <a href="#fig07">fig.
7</a>.</p>
<p>About once each month the salt is gathered. The women of the family
work naked in the stream-filled house, washing the crust of salt from
the stones into a large wooden trough, called
&ldquo;ko-long&prime;-ko.&rdquo; Each stone is thoroughly washed and
then replaced in the pavement. The saturated brine is preserved in a
gourd until sufficient is gathered for evaporation.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e5835width" id="fig07"><img src=
"images/fig07.jpg" alt="Ground plan of Mayinit salt house." width="211"

<p class="figureHead">Ground plan of Mayinit salt house.</p>
</div>
<p>Two or more families frequently join in evaporating their salt. The
brine is boiled in the large, shallow iron boilers, and from half a day
to a day is necessary to effect the evaporation. Evaporation is
discontinued when the salt is reduced to a thick paste.</p>
<p>The evaporated salt is spread in <span class="measure" title=
"a 13-millimeter">a half-inch</span> layer on a piece of banana leaf
cut about <span class="measure" title="125 millimeters">5 inches</span>
square. The leaf of paste is supported by two sticks on, but free from,
a piece of curved broken pottery which is the baking pan. The salt thus
prepared for baking is set near a fire in the dwelling where it is
baked thirty or forty minutes. It is then ready for use at home or for
commerce, and is preserved in the square, flat cakes called
&ldquo;luk&prime;-sa.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5849"
href="#xd21e5849" name="xd21e5849">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>Analyses have been made of Mayinit salt as prepared by the crude
method of the Igorot. The showing is excellent when the processes are
considered, the finished salt having 86.02 per cent of sodium chloride
as against 90.68 per cent for Michigan common salt and 95.35 for
Onondaga common salt.</p>

<p>One house produces from six to thirty cakes of salt at each baking.
A cake is valued at an equivalent of 5 cents, thus making an average
salt house, producing, say, fifteen cakes per month, worth 9 pesos per
year. Salt houses are seldom sold, but when they are they claim they
sell for only 3 or 4 pesos.</p>

<h4 class="main">Sugar</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In October and November the Bontoc Igorot make sugar
from cane. The stalks are gathered, cut in lengths of about
<span class="measure" title="50 centimeters">20 inches</span>, tied in
bundles <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">a foot</span> in
diameter, and stored away until the time for expressing the juice.</p>
<p>The sugar-cane crusher, shown in <a href="#pl118">Pl. CXVIII</a>,
consists of two sometimes of three, vertical, solid, hard-wood
cylinders set securely to revolve in two horizontal timbers, which, in
turn, are held in place by two uprights. One of the cylinders projects
above the upper horizontal timber and has fitted over it, as a key, a
long double-end sweep. This main cylinder conveys its power to the
others by means of wooden cogs which are set firmly in the wood and
play into sockets dug from the other cylinder. Boys commonly furnish
the power used to crush the cane, and there is much song and sport
during the hours of labor.</p>
<p>Two people, usually boys, sitting on both sides of the crusher, feed
the cane back and forth. Three or four stalks are put through at a
time, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6035" href="#xd21e6035" name=
"xd21e6035">148</a>]</span>and they are run through thirty or forty
times, or until they break into pieces of pulp not over <span class=
"measure" title="75 or 100 millimeters">three or four inches</span> in
length.</p>
<p>The juice runs down a slide into a jar set in the ground beneath the
crusher.</p>
<p>The boiling is done in large shallow iron boilers over an open fire
under a roof. I have known the Igorot to operate the crusher until
midnight, and to boil down the juice throughout the night.
Sugar-boiling time is known as a-su-fal&prime;-i-wis.</p>
<p>A delicious brown cake sugar is made, which, in some parts of the
area, is poured to cool and is preserved in bamboo tubes, in other
parts it is cooked and preserved in flat cakes <span class="measure"
title="25 millimeters">an inch</span> in thickness.</p>
<p>There is not much sugar made in the area, and a large part of the
product is purchased by the Ilokano. The Igorot cares very little for
sweets; even the children frequently throw away candy after tasting
it.</p>

<h4 class="main">Meals and mealtime</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The man of the family arises about 3.30 or 4
o&rsquo;clock in the morning. He builds the fires and prepares to cook
the family breakfast and the food for the pigs. A labor generally
performed each morning is the paring of camotes. In about half an hour
after the man arises the camotes and rice are put over to cook. The
daughters come home from the olag, and the boys from their sleeping
quarters shortly before breakfast. Breakfast, called
&ldquo;mang-an&prime;,&rdquo; meaning simply &ldquo;to eat,&rdquo; is
taken by all members of the family together, usually between 5 and 6
o&rsquo;clock. For this meal all the family, sitting on their haunches,
gather around three or four wooden dishes filled with steaming hot food
setting on the earth. They eat almost exclusively from their hands, and
seldom drink anything at breakfast, but they usually drink water after
the meal.</p>
<p>The members of the family who are to work away from the dwelling
leave about 7 or 7.30 o&rsquo;clock&mdash;but earlier, if there is a
rush of work. If the times are busy in the fields, the laborers carry
their dinner with them; if not, all members assemble at the dwelling
and eat their dinner together about 1 o&rsquo;clock. This midday meal
is often a cold meal, even when partaken in the house.</p>
<p>Field laborers return home about 6.30, at which time it is too dark
to work longer, but during the rush seasons of transplanting and
harvesting palay the Igorot generally works until 7 or 7.30 during
moonlight nights. All members of the family assemble for supper, and
this meal is always a warm one. It is generally cooked by the man,
unless there is a boy or girl in the family large enough to do it, and
who is not at work in the fields. It is usually eaten about 7 or 7.30
o&rsquo;clock, on the earth floor, as is the breakfast. A light is
used, a bright, smoking blaze of the pitch pine. It burns on a flat
stone kept ready in every house&mdash;it is certainly the first and
crudest house lamp, being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6060"
href="#xd21e6060" name="xd21e6060">149</a>]</span>removed in
development only one infinitesimal step from the Stationary fire. This
light is also sometimes employed at breakfast time, if the morning meal
is earlier than the sun.</p>
<p>Usually by 8 o&rsquo;clock the husband and wife retire for the
night, and the children leave home immediately after supper.</p>

<h3 class="main">Transportation</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The human is the only beast of burden in the Bontoc
area. Elsewhere in northern Luzon the Christianized people employ
horses, cattle, and carabaos as pack animals. Along the coastwise roads
cattle and carabaos haul two-wheel carts, and in the unirrigated
lowland rice tracts these same animals drag sleds surmounted by large
basket-work receptacles for the palay. The Igorot has doubtless seen
all of these methods of animal transportation, but the conditions of
his home are such that he can not employ them.</p>
<p>He has no roads for wheels; neither carabaos, cattle, nor horses
could go among his irrigated sementeras; and he has relatively few
loads of produce coming in and going out of his pueblo. Such loads as
he has can be transported by himself with greater safety and speed than
by quadrupeds; and so, since he almost never moves his place of abode,
he has little need of animal transportation.</p>
<p>To an extent the river is employed to transport boards, timbers, and
firewood to both Bontoc and Samoki during the high water of the rainy
season. Probably one-fourth of the firewood is borne by the river a
part of its journey to the pueblos. But there is no effort at
comprehensive water transportation; there are no boats or rafts, and
the wood which does float down the river journeys in single pieces.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Bontoc transportation is that the men
invariably carry all their heavy loads on their shoulders, and the
women as uniformly transport theirs on their heads.</p>
<p>In Benguet all people carry on their backs, as also do the women of
the Quiangan area.</p>
<p>In all heavy transportation the Bontoc men carry the spear, using
the handle as a staff, or now and then as a support for the load; the
women frequently carry a stick for a staff. Man&rsquo;s common
transportation vehicle is the ki-ma&prime;-ta, and in it he carries
palay, camotes, and manure. He swings along at a pace faster than the
walk, carrying from <span class="measure" title="35 to 45 kilograms">75
to 100 pounds</span>. He carries all firewood from the mountains,
directly on his bare shoulders. Large timbers for dwellings are borne
by two or more men directly on the shoulders; and timbers are now,
season of 1903, coming in for a schoolhouse carried by as many as
twenty-four men. Crosspieces, as yokes, are bound to the timbers with
bark lashings, and two or four men shoulder each yoke.</p>
<p>Rocks built into dams and dikes are carried directly on the bare
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6084" href="#xd21e6084" name=
"xd21e6084">150</a>]</span>shoulders. Earth, carried to or from the
building sementeras, in the trails, or about the dwellings, is put
first in the tak-o-ch&ucirc;g&prime;, the basket-work scoop, holding
about <span class="measure" title="15 kilograms">30 or 40 pounds</span>
of earth, and this is carried by wooden handles lashed to both sides
and is dumped into a transportation basket, called
&ldquo;ko-chuk-kod&prime;.&rdquo; This is invariably hoisted to the
shoulder when ready for transportation. When men carry water the
fang&prime;-a or olla is placed directly on the shoulder as are the
rocks.</p>
<p>When the man is to be away from home over night he usually carries
his food and blanket, if he has one, in the waterproof fang&prime;-ao
slung on his back and supported by a bejuco strap passing over each
shoulder and under the arm. This is the so-called &ldquo;head
basket,&rdquo; and, as a matter of fact, is carried on war expeditions
by those pueblos that use it, though it is also employed in more
peaceful occupations. As a cargador the man carries his burdens on the
shoulder in three ways&mdash;either double, the cargo on a pole between
two men; or singly, with the cargo divided and tied to both ends of the
pole; or singly, with the cargo laid directly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Women carry as large burdens as do the men. They have two commonly
employed transportation baskets, neither of which have I seen a man
even so much as pick up. These are the shallow, pan-shaped lu&prime;-wa
and the deeper, larger tay-ya-an&prime;. In these two baskets, and also
at times in the man&rsquo;s ki-ma&prime;-ta, the women carry the same
things as are borne by the men. Not infrequently the woman uses her two
baskets together at the same time&mdash;the tay-ya-an&prime; setting in
the lu&prime;-wa, as is shown in <a href="#pl119">Pls. CXIX</a> and
<a href="#pl121">CXXI</a>. When she carries the ki-ma&prime;-ta she
places the middle of the connecting pole, the pal-tang on her head,
with one basket before her and the other behind. At all times the woman
wears on her head beneath her burden a small grass ring <span class=
"measure" title="125 or 150 millimeters">5 or 6 inches</span> in
diameter, called a &ldquo;ki&prime;-kan.&rdquo; Its chief function is
that of a cushion, though when her burden is a fang&prime;-a of water
the ki&prime;-kan becomes also a base&mdash;without which the
round-bottomed olla could not be balanced on her head without the
support of her hands.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s rain protector is often brought home from the
camote gardens bottom up on the woman&rsquo;s head full of camote vines
as food for the pigs, or with long, dry grass for their bedding. And,
as has been noted, all day long during April and May, when there were
no camote vines, women and little girls were going about bearing their
small scoop-shaped s&ucirc;g-fi&prime; gathering wild vegetation for
the hogs.</p>
<p>Almost all of the water used in Bontoc is carried from the river to
the pueblo, a distance ranging from <span class="measure" title=
"400 to 800 meters">a quarter to half a mile</span>. The women and
girls of a dozen years or more probably transport three-fourths of the
water used about the house. It is carried in <span class="measure"
title="15 to 25 liter">4 to 6 gallon</span> ollas borne on the head of
the woman or shoulder of the man. Women totally blind, and many others
nearly blind, are seen alone at the river getting water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6113" href="#xd21e6113" name=
"xd21e6113">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>About half the women and many of the men who go to the river daily
for water carry babes. Children from 1 to 4 years old are frequently
carried to and from the sementeras by their parents, and at all times
of the day men, women, and children carry babes about the pueblo. They
are commonly carried on the back, sitting in a blanket which is slung
over one shoulder, passing under the other, and tied across the breast.
Frequently the babe is shifted forward, sitting astride the hip. At
times, though rarely, it is carried in front of the person. A frequent
sight is that of a woman with a babe in the blanket on her back and an
older child astride her hip supported by her encircling arm.</p>
<p>When one sees a woman returning from the river to the pueblo at
sundown a child on her back and a <span class="measure" title=
"25-liter">6-gallon</span> jar of water on her head, and knows that she
toiled ten or twelve hours that day in the field with her back bent and
her eyes on the earth like a quadruped, and yet finds her strong and
joyful, he believes in the future of the mountain people of Luzon if
they are guided wisely&mdash;they have the strength and courage to toil
and the elasticity of mind and spirit necessary for development.</p>

<h3 class="main">Commerce</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc Igorot has a keen instinct for a bargain,
but his importance as a comerciante has been small, since his wants are
few and the state of feud is such that he can not go far from home.</p>
<p>His bargain instinct is shown constantly. The American stranger is
charged from two to ten times the regular price for things he wishes to
buy. Early in April of the last two years the price of palay for the
American has, on a plea of scarcity, advanced 20 per cent, although it
has been proved that there is at all times enough palay in the pueblo
for three years&rsquo; consumption.</p>
<p>Rather than spoil a possible high price of a product, outside
pueblos have left articles overnight with Bontoc friends to be sold to
the American next day at his own price, and when those pueblos came
again to vend similar wares the high prices were maintained.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e6130">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Barter</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most commerce is carried on by barter. Within a pueblo
naturally having neither stores nor a legalized currency people trade
among themselves, but the word &ldquo;barter&rdquo; as here used means
the systematic exchange of the products of one community for those of
another.</p>
<p>To note the articles produced for commerce by two or three pueblos
will give a fair illustration of the importance which interpueblo
commerce carried on entirely by barter has assumed among the Igorot. of
the Bontoc culture group, though the comerciante rarely remains from
home more than one night at a time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6137" href="#xd21e6137" name="xd21e6137">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>The luwa, the woman&rsquo;s shallow transportation basket, is made
by the pueblo of Samoki only, and it is employed by fifteen or eighteen
other pueblos. Samoki also makes the akaug, or rice sieve, which is
used commonly in the vicinity. Bontoc and Samoki alone make the
woman&rsquo;s deeper transportation basket, the tayyaan, and it is used
quite as extensively as is the luwa.</p>
<p>The sleeping hat is made only by Bontoc and Samoki; it goes
extensively in commerce. The large winnowing tray employed universally
by the Igorot is said to be made nowhere in the vicinity except in
Samoki and Kamyu. Bontoc and Samoki alone make the man&rsquo;s dirt
scoop, the takochug, and it is invariably employed by all men laboring
in the sementeras.</p>
<p>Neither Bontoc nor Samoki is within the zone of bejuco, from which a
considerable part of their basket work is made, and, as a consequence,
the raw material is bartered for from pueblos one or two days distant.
Barlig furnishes most of the bejuco. Every manojo of Bontoc and Samoki
palay is tied up at harvest time with a strip of one variety of bamboo
called &ldquo;fika&rdquo; made by the pueblos from sections of bamboo
brought in bundles from a day&rsquo;s journey westward to barter during
April and May. The rain hat of the Bontoc man is coated with beeswax
coming in trade from Barlig, as does also the clear and pure resin used
by the women of Samoki in glazing their pots.</p>
<p>Towns to the east of Bontoc, such as Tukukan, Sakasakan, and
Tinglayan, grow tobacco which passes westward in trade from town to
town nearly, if not quite, through the Province of Lepanto. It doubles
its value for about every day of its journey, or at each trading.</p>
<p>Samoki pottery and the salt of Mayinit offer as good illustrations
as there are of the Igorot barter. A dozen loads of earthenware, from
sixty to seventy-five pots, leave Samoki at one time destined for a
single pueblo (see <a href="#pl123">Pl. CXXIII</a>). The Samoki pot is
made for a definite trade. Titipan uses many of a certain kind for her
commercial basi and the potters say that they make pots somewhat
different for about all the two dozen pueblos supplied by them. The
potter has learned the art of catering to the trade. There is not only
a variety of forms made but the capacity of the fangas ranges from
about <span class="measure" title="one liter to 35 and 45 liters">one
quart to ten and twelve gallons</span>, and each variety is made to
satisfy a particular and known demand. Samoki ware seldom passes as far
east as Sakasakan, only four or five hours distant, because similar
ware is made in Bituagan, which supplies not only Sakasakan but the
pueblos farther up the river.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be between 280 and 290 families dwelling in
Bontoc, and, at a conservative estimate, each family has eight fangas.
Each dwelling of a widow has several, so it is a fair estimate to say
there are 300 dwellings in the pueblo, having a total of 2,400 fangas.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6156" href="#xd21e6156" name=
"xd21e6156">153</a>]</span>Samoki has about 1,200 fangas in daily use.
The estimated population of the several towns that use Samoki pots is
24,000.</p>
<p>There is about one pot per individual in daily use in Bontoc and
Samoki, and this estimate is probably fair for the other pueblos. So
about 24,000 Samoki pots are daily in use, and this number is
maintained by the potters. Igorot claim the average life of a fanga of
Samoki is one year or less, so the pueblo must sell at least 24,000
pots per annum. At the average price of 5 centavos about the equivalent
of 1,200 pesos come to the pueblo annually from this art, or about 40
pesos for each of the thirty potters, whether or not she works at her
art. A few years ago, during a severe state of feud, Samoki pots
increased in value about thirty-fold; it is said that the potters
purchased carabao for ten large ollas each. To-day the large ollas are
worth about 2 pesos, and carabaos are valued at from 40 to 70
pesos.</p>
<p>Mayinit salt passes in barter to about as many pueblos as do the
Samoki pots, but while the pots go westward to the border of the Bontoc
culture area the salt passes far beyond the eastern border, being
bartered from pueblo to pueblo. It does not go far north of Mayinit, or
go at all regularly far west, because those pueblos within access of
the China Sea coast buy salt evaporated from sea water by the Ilokano
of Candon. In April at two different times twelve loads of Candon salt
passed eastward through Bontoc on the shoulders of Tukukan men, but
during the rainy season and the busy planting and harvesting months
Mayinit salt supplies a large demand.</p>
<p>In Bontoc and Samoki there are about one hundred and fifty gold
earrings which came from the gold-producing country about Suyak,
Lepanto Province. Carabaos are almost invariably traded for these.
Sometimes one carabao, sometimes two, and again three are bartered for
one gold earring. During the months of March and April the pueblo of
Balili traded three of these earrings to Bontoc men for carabaos, and
this particular form of barter has been carried on for generations.</p>
<p>Balili, Alap, Sadanga, Takong, Sagada, Titipan and other pueblos
between Bontoc pueblo and Lepanto Province to the west weave
breechcloths and skirts which are brought by their makers and disposed
of to Bontoc and adjacent pueblos. Agawa, Genugan, and Takong bring in
clay and metal pipes of their manufacture. Much of these productions is
bartered directly for palay. If money is paid for the articles it is
invariably turned into palay, because this is the greatest constant
need of manufacturing Igorot pueblos.</p>

<h4 class="main">Sale</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Spaniard left his impress on the Igorot of Bontoc
pueblo in no realm probably more surely than in that of the
appreciation of the value of money. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6172" href="#xd21e6172" name="xd21e6172">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sale instinct, and not the barter instinct, is foremost now in
Bontoc and Samoki when an American is a party to a bargain, and this is
true in all pueblos on the main trail to Lepanto and the west coast.
But one has little difficulty in bartering for Igorot productions if he
has things the people want&mdash;such as brass wire, cloth for the
woman&rsquo;s skirt, the man&rsquo;s breechcloth, a shirt, or coat. In
many pueblos the people try to buy for money the articles the American
brings in for barter, although it is true that barter will often get
from them many things which money can not buy. To the northeast and
south of Bontoc barter will purchase practically anything.</p>
<p>The conditions of peace among the pueblos since the arrival of the
Americans and the money which is now everywhere within the area have
been the important factors in helping to develop interpueblo commerce
from barter to sale.</p>
<p>Most of the clothing worn in the pueblos of Lepanto Province is made
from cotton purchased for money at the coast. With few exceptions the
breechcloths and blankets worn by Bontoc and Samoki are purchased for
money, though it is not very many years since the bark breechcloth made
in Titipan and Barlig was worn, and in Tulubin, only two hours distant,
Barlig blankets and breechcloths of whole bark are worn to-day.</p>
<p>One week in April a Bontoc Igorot traded a carabao to an Ilokano of
Lepanto Province for a copper ganza, the customary way of purchasing
ganzas, and the following week another Bontoc man sold a carabao for
money to another Lepanto Ilokano.</p>
<p>The Baliwang battle-ax and spear are now more generally sold for
money than is any other production made or disposed of within the
Bontoc area. They are said to-day to be seldom bartered for.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e6183">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Medium of exchange</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That a people with such incipient social and political
institutions as has the Bontoc Igorot should have developed a
&ldquo;money&rdquo; is remarkable. The North American Indian with his
strong tendency and adaptability to political organization had no such
money. Nothing of the kind has been presented as belonging to the
Australian of ultrasocial development, and I am not aware that anything
equal has been produced by other similar primitive peoples. However, it
seems not improbable that allied tribes (say, of Malayan stock) which
have solved the problem of subsistence in a like way have a similar
currency, although I find no mention of it among four score of writers
whose observations on similar tribes of Borneo have come to hand, and
nothing similar has yet been found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Bontoc Igorot has a &ldquo;medium of exchange&rdquo; which gives
a &ldquo;measure of exchange value&rdquo; for articles bought and sold,
and which has a &ldquo;standard of value.&rdquo; In other words he has
&ldquo;good money&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6190" href=
"#xd21e6190" name="xd21e6190">155</a>]</span>probably the best money
that could have been devised by him for his society. It is his staple
product&mdash;palay, the unthreshed rice.</p>
<p>Palay is at all times good money, and it is the thing commonly
employed in exchange. It answers every purpose of a suitable medium of
exchange. It is always in demand, since it is the staple food. It is
kept eight or ten years without deterioration. Except when used to
purchase clothing, it is seldom heavier or more difficult to transport
than is the object for which it is exchanged. It is of very stable
value, so much so that as a purchaser of Igorot labor and products its
value is constant; and it can not be counterfeited.</p>
<p>Aside from this universal medium of exchange the characteristic
production of each community, in a minor way, answers for the community
the needs of a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Samoki buys many things with her pots, such as tobacco and salt from
Mayinit; cloth from Igorot comerciantes, breechcloth and basi from the
Igorot producers; chickens, pigs, palay, and camotes from neighboring
pueblos. Mayinit uses her salt in much the same way, only probably to a
less extent. Salt is not consumed by all the people.</p>
<p>To-day, as formerly, the live pig and hog and pieces of pork and
carabao meat are used a great deal in barter. As far back as the pueblo
memory extends pigs have been used to purchase a particularly good
breechcloth called &ldquo;balakes,&rdquo; made in Balangao, three days
east of Bontoc.</p>
<p>In all sales the medium of exchange is entirely in coin. Paper will
not be received by the Igorot. The peso (the Spanish and Mexican silver
dollar) passes in the area at the rate of two to one with American
money. There is also the silver half peso, the peseta or one-fifth
peso, and the half peseta. The latter two are not plentiful. The only
other coin is the copper &ldquo;sip&#277;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No centavos (cents) reach the districts of Lepanto and Bontoc from
Manila, and for years the Igorot of the copper region of Suyak and
Mankayan, Lepanto, have manufactured a counterfeit copper coin called
&ldquo;sip&#277;n.&rdquo; All the half-dozen copper coins current in
the active commercial districts of the Islands are here counterfeited,
and the &ldquo;sip&#277;n&rdquo; passes at the high rate of 80 per
peso; it is common and indispensable. A crude die is made in clay, and
has to be made anew for each &ldquo;sip&#277;n&rdquo; coined. The
counterfeit passes throughout the area, but in Tinglayan, just beyond
its eastern border, it is not known. Within two days farther east small
coins are unknown, the peso being the only money value in common
knowledge.</p>

name="xd21e6209">156</a>]</span>to a &#8369;70 carabao, is measured in
palay. To-day, as formerly, every bargain between two Igorot is made on
the basis of the palay value of the articles bought or sold. This is so

<h4 class="main">Trade routes</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Commerce passes quite commonly within the Bontoc
culture area from one pueblo to the next, and even to the second and
third pueblos if they are friends; but the general direction is along
the main river (the Chico), southwest and northeast, since here the
people cling. This being the case, those living to the south and north
of this line have much less commerce than those along the river route.
For instance, practically no people now pass through Ambawan, southeast
of Bontoc. It is the last pueblo in the area along the old Spanish
calzada between the culture areas of Bontoc and Quiangan to the south.
No people live <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6327" href=
"#xd21e6327" name="xd21e6327">157</a>]</span>farther southward along
the route for nearly a day, and the first pueblos met are enemies of
Ambawan, fearful and feared. The only commerce between the two culture
areas over this route passes when a detachment of native Constabulary
soldiers makes the journey. Naturally the area traversed by a
comerciante is limited by the existing feuds. The trader will not go
among enemies without escort.</p>
<p>Besides the general trade route up and down the river, there is one
between Bontoc and Barlig to the east via Kanyu and Tulubin. At Barlig
the trail splits, one branch running farther eastward through Lias and
Balangao and the other going southward through the Cambulo area&mdash;a
large valley of people said to be similar in culture to those of
Quiangan.</p>
<p>Another route from Bontoc leaves the main trail at Titipan and joins
the pueblos of Tunnolang, Fidelisan, and Agawa in a general southwest
direction. From Agawa the trail crosses the mountains, keeping its
general southwest course. It turns westward at the Rio Balasian, which
it follows to Ankiling on the Rio del Abra. The route is then along the
main road to Candon on the coast via Salcedo.</p>
<p>Mayinit, the salt-producing pueblo, has her outlet on the main trail
via Bontoc, but she also passes eastward to the main trail at
Sakasakan, going through Baliwang, the battle-ax pueblo. She has no
outlet to the north.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e6335">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Trade languages and traders</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Since the commerce is to-day nearly all interpueblo,
the common language of the Igorot is used almost exclusively in trade.
While the Spaniards were occupying the country, Chinamen&mdash;the
&ldquo;Chino&rdquo; of the Islands&mdash;passed up from the coast as
far as Bontoc, and even farther; the Ilokano also came. They brought
much of the iron now in the country, and also came with brass wire,
cloth, cotton, gangsas, and salt. These two classes of traders took
out, in the main, the money and carabaos of the Igorot, and the
Spaniard&rsquo;s coffee, cocoa, and money. To-day no comerciante from
the coast dares venture farther inland than Sagada. Of the tradesmen
the Chinese did not apparently affect the trade language at all, since
the Chino commonly employs the Ilokano language. The Spanish gave the
words of salutation, as &ldquo;Buenos d&iacute;as&rdquo; (good day) and
&ldquo;&aacute; Dios&rdquo; (adieu); he also gave some of the names of
coins. The peso, the silver dollar, is commonly called
&ldquo;peho.&rdquo; However, the medio peso is known as
&ldquo;thalepi,&rdquo; from the Ilokano &ldquo;salepi.&rdquo; The
peseta is called &ldquo;peseta;&rdquo; and the media peseta is known as
&ldquo;dies ay seis&rdquo; (ten and six), or, simply,
&ldquo;seis&rdquo;&mdash;it is from the Spanish, meaning sixteen
quartos.</p>
<p>The Ilokano language was the more readily adopted, since it is of
Malayan origin, and is heard west of the Igorot with increasing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6342" href="#xd21e6342" name=
"xd21e6342">158</a>]</span>frequency until its home is reached on the
coast. Among the Ilokano words common in the language of commerce are
the following:</p>
<p>Ma&prime;-no, how much; a-sin&prime;, salt; ba&prime;-ag,
breechcloth; bu-ya&prime;-ang, black; con-di&prime;-man, red;
fan-cha&prime;-la, blanket, white, with end stripes; pas-li-o&prime;,
Chinese bar iron from which axes, spears, and bolos are made;
ba-rot&prime;, brass wire; pi-nag-pa&prime;-gan, a woman&rsquo;s
blanket of distinctive design.</p>
<p>An Americanism used commonly in commercial transactions in the area,
and also widely in northern Luzon, is &ldquo;no got.&rdquo; It is an
expression here to stay, and its simplicity as a vocalization has had
much to do with its adoption.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e6349">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Stages of commerce</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The commerce of the Igorot illustrates what seems to
be the first distinctively commercial activity. Preceding it is the
stage of barter between people who casually meet and who trade carried
possessions on the whim of the moment. If we wish to dignify this kind
of barter, it may properly be called &ldquo;Fortuitous
Commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next stage, one of the two illustrated by the Igorot of the
Bontoc culture area, is that in which commodities are produced before a
widespread or urgent demand exists for them in the minds of those who
eventually become consumers through commerce. Such commodities result
largely from a local demand and a local supply of raw materials.
Gradually they spread over a widening area, carried by their producers
whose home demand is, for the time, supplied, and who desire some
commodity to be obtained among another people. Such venders never or
rarely go alone to exchange their goods, which, also, are seldom
produced by simply one person, but by a number of individuals or a
considerable group. The motive prompting this commerce is the desire on
the part of the trader to obtain the commodity for which he goes. In
order to obtain it in honor, he attempts to thrust his own productions
on the others by carrying his commodities among them. Commerce in this
stage may be called &ldquo;Irregular Intrusive Commerce.&rdquo; It also
has its birth and development in barter.</p>
<p>A higher stage of commerce, an immediate outgrowth of the preceding,
is that in which the producer anticipates a known demand for his
commodity, and at irregular times carries his stock to the consumers.
This commerce may be called &ldquo;Irregular Invited Commerce.&rdquo;
It is in this stage that a medium of exchange is likely to develop.
This class of commerce is also in full operation in Bontoc to-day.</p>
<p>A higher form is that in which the producer keeps a supply of his
commodity on hand, and periodically displays it repeatedly in a known
place&mdash;a &ldquo;market.&rdquo; This stage also may be developed
simply through barter, as is seen among certain pueblo Indians of
southwestern United States, but the Bontoc man has not begun to dream
of a &ldquo;market&rdquo; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6360"
href="#xd21e6360" name="xd21e6360">159</a>]</span>satisfying his
material wants. Such commerce may be called &ldquo;Periodic Free
Commerce.&rdquo; It is widespread in the Philippines, displaying both
barter and sale. In many places in the Archipelago to-day, especially
in Mindanao, periodic commerce is carried on regularly on neutral
territory. Market places are selected where products are put down by
one party which then retires temporarily, and are taken up by the other
party which comes and leaves its own productions in exchange.</p>
<p>Growing out of these monthly, semimonthly, weekly, biweekly, and
triweekly markets, as one sees them in the Philippines, is a still
higher form of commerce carried on very largely by sale, but not
entirely so. It may be called &ldquo;Continual Free
Commerce.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Property right</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The idea of property right among the Igorot is clear.
The recognition of property right is universal, and is seldom disputed,
notwithstanding the fact that the right of ownership rests simply in
the memory of the people&mdash;the only property mark being the ear
slit of the half-wild carabao.</p>
<p>The majority of property disputes which have come to light since the
Americans have been in Bontoc probably would not have occurred nor
would the occasion for them have existed in a society of Igorot
control. It is claimed in Bontoc that the Spaniard there settled most
disputes which came to him in favor of the party who would pay the most
money. In this way, it is said, the rich became the richer at the
expense of the poor. This condition is suggested by recent
<i>reclamos</i> made by poor people. Again, since the American heard
the <i>reclamos</i> of all classes of people, the poor who, according
to Igorot custom, forfeited sementeras to those richer as a penalty for
stealing palay, have come to dispute the ownership of certain real
property.</p>

<h4 class="main">Personal property of individual</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most articles of personal property are individual.
Such property consists of clothing, ornaments, implements, and utensils
of out-of-door labor, the weapons of warfare, and such chickens, dogs,
hogs, carabaos, food stuffs, and money as the person may have at the
time of marriage or may inherit later.</p>
<p>Four of the richest men of Bontoc own fifty carabaos each, and one
of them owns thirty hogs. Two other men and a woman, all called equally
rich, own ten head of carabaos each. Others have fewer, while two of
the ten richest men in the pueblo, have no carabaos. Some of these men
have eight granaries, holding from two to three hundred cargoes each,
now full of palay. Carabaos are at present valued in Bontoc at about 50
pesos, and hogs average about 8 pesos. All rich people own one or more
gold earrings valued at from one to two carabaos each. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All household implements and utensils and all money,
food stuffs, chickens, dogs, hogs, and carabaos accumulated by a
married couple are the joint property of the two.</p>
<p>Such personal property as hogs and carabaos are frequently owned by
individuals of different families. It is common for three or four
persons to buy a carabao, and even ten have become joint owners of one
animal through purchase. Through inheritance two or more people become
joint owners of single carabao, and of small herds which they prefer to
own in common, pending such an increase that the herd may be divided
equally without slaughtering an animal. Until recent years two, three,
and even four or five men jointly owned one battle-ax.</p>
<p>As the Igorot acquires more money, or, as the articles desired
become relatively cheaper, personal property of the group (outside the
family group) is giving way to personal property of the individual. The
extinction of this kind of property is logical and is approaching.</p>

<p class="first">The individual owns dwelling houses, granaries, camote
lands about the dwellings and in the mountains, millet and maize lands,
in the mountains, irrigated rice lands, and mountain lands with
forests. In fact, the individual may own all forms of real property
known to the people.</p>
<p>It is largely by the possession or nonpossession of real property
that a man is considered rich or poor. This fact is due to the more
apparent and tangible form of real than personal property. The ten
richest people in Bontoc, nine men and a woman, own, it is said, in
round numbers one hundred sementeras each. The average value of a
sementera is 10 pesos for every cargo of palay it produces annually. A
sementera producing 10 cargoes is rated a very good one, and yet there
are those yielding 20, 25, 30, and even 40 cargoes. <span class=

<p>It is practically impossible to get the truth concerning the value
of the personal or real property of the Igorot in Bontoc, because they
are not yet sure the American will not presently tax them unjustly, as
they say the Spaniard did. But the following figures are believed to be
true in every particular. Mang-i-lot&prime;, an old man whose ten
children are all dead, and who says his property is no longer of value
because he has no children with whom to leave it, is believed to have
spoken truthfully when he said he has the following sementeras in the
five following geographic areas surrounding the pueblo:</p>
<div class="table">

</div>
<p>These sementeras produce the low average of 3&#8531; cargoes. The
average value of Mang-i-lot&rsquo;s&prime; sementeras, then, is
33&#8531; pesos&mdash;which is thought to be a conservative estimate of
the value of the Bontoc sementera. Mang-i-lot&prime; is rated among the
lesser rich men. He is relatively, as the American says,
&ldquo;well-to-do.&rdquo; However, when a man possesses twenty
sementeras he is considered rich.</p>
<p>The richest man in Bontoc, with one hundred sementeras, has in them,
say, 3,330 pesos worth of real property in addition to his 6,340 pesos
of personal property.</p>
<p>It is claimed that each household owns its dwelling and at least two
sementeras and one granary, though a man with no more property than
this is a poor man and some one in his family must work much of the
time for wages, because two average sementeras will not furnish all the
rice needed by a family for food.</p>
<p>A dwelling house is valued at about 60 pesos, which is less than it
usually costs to build, and a granary is valued at about 10 or 15
pesos. It is constructed with great care, is valueless unless rodent
proof, and costs much more than its avowed valuation.</p>
<p>Title to all buildings, building lands in the pueblo, and irrigated
rice lands is recognized for at least two generations, though
unoccupied during that time. They say the right to such unoccupied
property would be recognized perpetually if there were heirs. At least
it is true that there are now <span class="measure" title=
"hectares">acres</span> of unused lands, once palay sementeras, which
have not been cultivated for two generations because water can
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6509" href="#xd21e6509" name=
"xd21e6509">162</a>]</span>not be run to them, and the property right
of the grandsons of the men who last cultivated them is recognized.
However, if one leaves vacant any unirrigated agricultural mountain
lands&mdash;used for millet, maize, or beans&mdash;another person may
claim and plant them in one year&rsquo;s time, and no one disputes his
title.</p>

<p>No form of real property, except forests, can be the joint property

property of a considerable group of people&mdash;the descendants of a
single ancestral owner. The lands as well as the trees are owned, and
the sale of trees carries no right to the land on which they grow. It
is impossible even to estimate the value of any one&rsquo;s forest
property, but it is true that persons are recognized as rich or poor in
forests.</p>

<h4 class="main">Public property</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Public lands and forests extend in an irregular strip
around most pueblos. There is no public forest, or even public lands,
between Bontoc and Samoki, but Bontoc has access to the forests lying
beyond her sister pueblo. Neither is there public forest, or any
forest, between Bontoc and Tukukan, and Bontoc and Titipan, though
there are public lands. In all other directions from Bontoc public
forests surround the outlying private forests. They are usually from
three to six hours distant. From them any man gathers what he pleases,
but until the American came to Bontoc the Igorot seldom went that far
for wood or lumber, as it was unsafe. Now, however, the individual will
doubtless claim these lands, unless hindered by the Government. In this
manner real property was first accumulated&mdash;a man claimed public
lands and forests which he cared for and dared to appropriate and use.
There have been few irrigated sementeras built on new water supplies in
two generations by people of Bontoc pueblo. The &ldquo;era of public
lands&rdquo; for Bontoc has practically passed; there is no more
undiscovered water. However, three new sementeras were built this year
on an island in the river near the pueblo, and are now (May, 1903) full
of splendid palay, but they can not be considered permanent property,
as an excessively rainy season will make them unfit for
cultivation.</p>

<h4 class="main">Sale of property</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Personal property commonly passes by transfer for
value received from one party to another. Such a thing as transfer of
real property from one Igorot to another for legal currency is unknown;
the transfer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6528" href="#xd21e6528"
name="xd21e6528">163</a>]</span>is by barter. The transfer of personal
property was considered in the preceding section on commerce.</p>
<p>Real property is seldom transferred for value received except at the
death of the owner or a member of the family; at such times it is
common, and occurs from the necessity of quantities of food for the
burial feasts and the urgent need of blankets and other clothing for
the interment.</p>
<p>Again, camote lands about the dwellings are disposed of to those who
may want to build a dwelling. Dwellings are also disposed of if the
original occupant is to vacate and some other person desires to possess
the buildings.</p>
<p>Death may destroy one&rsquo;s personal property, such as hogs and
carabaos, but almost never does an Igorot &ldquo;lose his
property,&rdquo; if it is real. Only a protracted family sickness or a
series of deaths requiring the killing of great numbers of chickens,
hogs, and carabaos, and the purchase of many things necessary for
interment can lose to a person real property of any considerable
value.</p>
<p>There is no formality to a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of property, nor are
witnesses employed. It is common knowledge within the ato when a sale
is on, and the old men shortly know of and talk about the
transaction&mdash;thenceforth it is on record and will stand.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e6538">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Rent, loan, and lease of property</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Until recent years, long after the Spaniards came, it
was customary to loan money and other forms of personal property
without interest or other charge. This generous custom still prevails
among most of the people, but some rich men now charge an interest on
money loaned for one or more years. Actual cases show the rate to be
about 6 or 7 per cent. The custom of loaning for interest was gained
from contact with the Lepanto Igorot, who received it from the
Ilokano.</p>
<p>It is claimed that dwellings and granaries are never rented.</p>
<p>Irrigated rice lands are commonly leased. Such method of cultivation
is resorted to by the rich who have more sementeras than they can
superintend. The lessee receives one-half of the palay harvested, and
his share is delivered to him. The lessor furnishes all seed,
fertilizers, and labor. He delivers the lessee&rsquo;s share of the
harvest and retains the other half himself, together with the entire
camote crop&mdash;which is invariably grown immediately after the palay
harvest.</p>
<p>Unirrigated mountain camote lands are rented outright; the rent is
usually paid in pigs. A sementera that produces a yield of 10 cargoes
of camotes, valued at about six pesos, is worth a 2-peso pig as annual
rental. In larger sementeras a proportional rental is charged&mdash;a
rental of about 33&#8531; per cent. All rents are paid after the crops
are harvested. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6549" href=

<h3 class="main">Inheritance and bequest</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As regards property the statement that all men are
born equal is as false in Igorot land as in the United States. The
economic status of the present generation and the preceding one was
practically determined for each man before he was born. It is fair to
make the statement that the rich of the present generation had rich
grandparents and the poor had poor grandparents, although it is true
that a large property is now and then lost sight of in its division
among numerous children.</p>
<p>Children before their marriage receive little permanent property
during the lives of their parents, and they retain none which they may
accumulate themselves. A mother sometimes gives her daughter the hair
dress of white and agate beads, called &ldquo;apong;&rdquo; also she
may give a mature daughter her peculiar and rare girdle, called
&ldquo;akosan.&rdquo; Either parent may give a child a gold earring; I
know of but one such case. This custom of not allowing an unmarried
child to possess permanent property is so rigid that, I am told, an
unmarried son or daughter seldom receives carabaos or sementeras until
the death of the parents, no matter how old the child may be.</p>
<p>At the time of marriage parents give their children considerable
property, if they have it, giving even one-half the sementeras they
possess. If parents are no longer able to cultivate their lands when
their children marry, they usually give them all they have, and their
wants are faithfully met by the children.</p>
<p>The conditions presented above are practically the only ones in
which the property owner controls the disposition of his possessions
which pass in gift to kin.</p>
<p>The laws of inheritance and bequest are as firmly fixed as are the
customs of giving and not giving during life.</p>
<p>Since all the property of a husband and wife is individual, except
that accumulated by the joint efforts of the two during union, the
property of each is divided on death. The survivor of a matrimonial
union receives no share of the individual property of the deceased if
there are kin. It goes first to the children or grandchildren. If there
are none and a parent survives, it goes to the parent. If there are
neither children, grandchildren, nor parents it goes to brothers and
sisters or their children. If there are none of these relatives the
property goes to the uncles and aunts or cousins. This seems to be the
extent of the kinship recognized by the Igorot. If there are no
relatives the property passes to the survivor of the union. If there is
no survivor the property passes to that friend who takes up the
responsibilities of the funeral and accompanying ceremonies. The law of
inheritance, then, is as follows: First, lineal descendants; second,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6565" href="#xd21e6565" name=
"xd21e6565">165</a>]</span>ascendants; third, lateral descendants;
fourth, surviving spouse; fifth, self-appointed executor who was a
personal friend of the deceased.</p>
<p>Primogeniture is recognized, and the oldest living child, whether
male or female, inherits slightly more than any of the others. For
instance, if there were three or four or five sementeras per child, the
eldest would receive one more than the others.</p>
<p>This law of primogeniture holds at all times, but if there are three
boys and one girl the girl is given about the same advantage over the
others, it is said, as though she were the eldest. If there are three
girls and only one boy, no consideration is taken of sex. When there
are only two children the eldest receives the largest or best
sementera, but he must also take the smallest or poorest one.</p>
<p>It is said that division of the property of the <span class="corr"
title="Source: deseased">deceased</span> occurs during the days of the
funeral ceremonies. This was done on the third day of the ceremonies at
the funeral of old Som-kad&prime;, mentioned in the section on
&ldquo;Death and Burial?&rdquo; The laws are rigid, and all that is
necessary to be done is for the lawful inheritors to decide which
particular property becomes the possession of each. This is neither so
difficult nor so conducive of friction as might seem, since the
property is very undiversified.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Tribute, tax, and &ldquo;rake off&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no true systematic tribute, tax, or
&ldquo;rake off&rdquo; among the Bontoc Igorot, nor am I aware that
such occurs at all commonly sporadically. However, tribute, tax, and
&ldquo;rake off&rdquo; are all found in pure Malayan culture in the
Archipelago, as among the Moros of the southern islands.</p>
<p>Tribute may be paid more or less regularly by one group of people to
a stronger, or to one in a position to harass and annoy&mdash;for the
protection of the stronger, or in acknowledgment of submission, or to
avoid harassment or annoyance. Nothing of the sort exists in Bontoc.
The nearest approach to it is the exchange of property, as carabaos or
hogs, between two pueblos at the time a peace is made between
them&mdash;at which time the one sueing for peace makes by far the
larger payment, the other payment being mere form. This transaction, as
it occurs in Bontoc, is a recognition of submission and of inferiority,
and is, as well, a guarantee of a certain amount of protection.
However, such payments are not made at all regularly and do not stand
as true tributes, though in time they might grow to be such.</p>
<p>Nothing in the nature of a tax for the purpose of supporting a
government exists in Bontoc. The nearest approach to it is in a
practice which grew up in Spanish time but is of Igorot origin. When
to-day cargadors are required by Americans, as when Government supplies
must be brought in, the members of each cargador&rsquo;s ato furnish
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6585" href="#xd21e6585" name=
"xd21e6585">166</a>]</span>food for the journey, though the cargador
personally receives and keeps the wage for the trip. The furnishing of
food seems to spring from the feeling that the man who goes on the
journey is the public servant of those who remain&mdash;he is doing an
unpleasant duty for his ato fellows. If this were carried one step
further, if the rice were raised and paid for carrying on some regular
function of the Igorot pueblo, it would be a true tax. It may be true,
and probably is, in pure Igorot society that if men were sent by an ato
on some mission for that ato they would receive support while gone.
This would readily develop into a true tax if those public duties were
to be performed continually, or even frequently with regularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rake off,&rdquo; or, as it is known in the Orient,
&ldquo;squeeze,&rdquo; is so common that every one&mdash;Malay, Chino,
Japanese, European, and American&mdash;expects his money to be
&ldquo;squeezed&rdquo; if it passes through another&rsquo;s hands or
another is instrumental in making a bargain for him. In much of the
Igorot territory surrounding the Bontoc area &ldquo;rake off&rdquo;
occurs&mdash;it follows the advent of the &ldquo;headman.&rdquo; It is
one of the direct causes why, in Igorot society, the headman is almost
always a rich man. During the hunting stage of human development no
&ldquo;rich man&rdquo; can come up, as is illustrated by the primitive
hunter folk of North America. As soon, however, as there are
productions which may be traded in, there is a chance for one man to
take advantage of his fellows and accumulate a part of their
productions&mdash;this opportunity occurs among primitive agricultural
people. The Bontoc area, however, has no &ldquo;headman,&rdquo; no
&ldquo;rich man,&rdquo; and, consequently, no &ldquo;rake off.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">Chapter V</h2>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Political Life and Control</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is impossible to put one&rsquo;s hand on any one
man or any one group of men in Bontoc pueblo of whom it may be said,
&ldquo;Here is the control element of the pueblo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nowhere has the Malayan attained national organization. He is known
in the Philippines as a &ldquo;provincial,&rdquo; but in most districts
he is not even that. The Bontoc Igorot has not even a clan
organization, to say nothing of a tribal organization. I fail to find a
trace of matriarchy or patriarchy, or any mark of a kinship group which
traces relationship farther than first cousins.</p>
<p>The Spaniard created a &ldquo;presidente&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;vice-presidente&rdquo; for the various pueblos he sought to
control, but these men, as often Ilokano as Igorot, were the avenue of
Spanish approach to the natives&mdash;they were almost never the
natives&rsquo; mouthpiece. The influence of such officials was not at
all of the nature to create or foster the feeling of political
unity.</p>
<p>Aside from these two pueblo officers the government and control of
the pueblo is purely aboriginal. Each ato, of which, as has been noted,
there are seventeen, has its group of old men called
&ldquo;&#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan.&rdquo; This &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan
is not an organization, except that it is intended to be perpetual,
and, in a measure, self-perpetuating. It is a thoroughly democratic
group of men, since it is composed of all the old men in the ato, no
matter how wise or foolish, rich or poor&mdash;no matter what the
man&rsquo;s social standing may be. Again, it is democratic&mdash;the
simplest democracy&mdash;in that is has no elective organization, no
headmen, no superiors or inferiors whose status in the
&#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan is determined by the members of the group.
The feature of self-perpetuation displays itself in that it decides
when the various men of the ato become am-a&prime;-ma, &ldquo;old
men,&rdquo; and therefore members of the &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan. A
person is told some day to come and counsel with the
&#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan, and thenceforth he is a member of the
group.</p>
<p>In all matters with which the &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan deals it is
supreme in its ato, but in the ato only; hence the opening statement of
the chapter that no man or group of men holds the control of the
pueblo. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6603" href="#xd21e6603"
name="xd21e6603">168</a>]</span>life of the several ato has been so
similar for such a number of generations that, in matters of general
interest, the thoughts of one &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan will be
practically those of all others. For instance, there are eight
ceremonial occasions on which the entire pueblo rests from agricultural
labors, simply because each ato observes the same ceremonials on
identical days. In one of these ceremonials, all the men of the entire
pueblo have a rock contest with all the men of Samoki. Again, when a
person of the pueblo has been killed by another pueblo treacherously or
in ambush, or in any way except by fair fight, the pueblo as a unit
hastens to avenge the death on the pueblo of the slayer.</p>
<p>In such matters as these&mdash;matters of common defense and
offense, matters of religion wherein food supply is
concerned&mdash;custom has long since crystallized into an act of
democratic unity what may once have been the result of the councils of
all the &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan of the pueblo. It is customary for an
ato to rest from agricultural labor on the funeral day of any adult
man, but the entire pueblo thus seeks to honor at his death the man who
was old and influential.</p>
<p>There is little differentiation of the functions of the
&#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan. It hears, reviews, and judges the individual
disagreements of the members of the ato and makes laws by determining
custom. It also executes its judgments or sees that they are executed.
It makes treaties of peace, sends and accepts or rejects challenges of
war for its ato. In case of interato disagreements of individuals the
two &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan meet and counsel together, representing
the interests of the persons of their ato. In other words, the pueblo
is a federation made up of seventeen geographical and political units,
in each of which the members recognize that their sanest, ripest wisdom
dwells with the men who have had the longest experience in life; and
the group of old men&mdash;sometimes only one man and sometimes a
dozen&mdash;is known as &#301;n-tug-tu&prime;-kan, and its wisdom is
respected to the degree that it is regularly sought and is accepted as
final judgment, being seldom ignored or dishonored. In matters of a
common interest the pueblo customarily acts as a unit. Probably could
it not so act, factions would result causing separation from the
federation. This state of things is hinted as one of the causes why the
ancestors of present Samoki separated from the pueblo of Bontoc. The
fact that they did separate is common knowledge, and a cause frequently
assigned is lack of space to develop. However, there may have been
disagreement.</p>
<div id="xd21e6609" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Crimes, detection and punishment</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Theft, lying to shield oneself in some criminal act,
assault and battery, adultery, and murder are the chief crimes against
Igorot society.</p>
<p>There are tests to determine which of several suspects is guilty of
a crime. One of these is the rice-chewing test. The old men of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6616" href="#xd21e6616" name=
"xd21e6616">169</a>]</span>ato interested assemble, in whose presence
each suspect is made to chew a mouthful of raw rice, which, when it is
thoroughly masticated, is ejected on to a dish. Each mouthful is
examined, and the person whose rice is the driest is considered guilty.
It is believed that the guilty one will be most nervous during the
trial, thus checking a normal flow of saliva.</p>
<p>Another is a hot-water test. An egg is placed in an olla of boiling
water, and each suspect is obliged to pick it out with his hand. When
the guilty man draws out the egg the hot water leaps up and burns the
forearm.</p>
<p>There is an egg test said to be the surest one of all. A battle-ax
blade is held at an angle of about 60 degrees, and an egg is placed at
the top in a position to slide down. Just before the egg is freed from
the hand the question is asked &ldquo;Is Liod (the name of the man
under trial) guilty?&rdquo; If the egg slides down the blade to the
bottom the man named is innocent but if it sticks on the ax he is
guilty.</p>
<p>There is also a blood test employed in Bontoc pueblo, and also to
the west, extending, it is said, into Lepanto Province. An instrument
consisting of a sharp spike of iron projecting about <span class=
"measure" title="1.5 millimeter">one-sixteenth of an inch</span> from a
handle with broad shoulders is placed against the scalp of the suspects
and the handle struck a sharp blow. The projecting shoulder is supposed
to prevent the spike from entering the scalp of one farther than that
of another. The person who bleeds most is considered guilty&mdash;he is
&ldquo;hot headed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was once present at an Igorot trial when the question to be
decided was whether a certain man or a certain woman had lied. The old
men examined and cross-questioned both parties for fully a quarter of
an hour, at which time they announced that the woman was the liar. Then
they brought a test to bear evidence in binding their decision. They
killed a chicken and cut it open. The gall was found to be almost
entirely exposed on the liver&mdash;clearly the woman had lied. She
looked at the all-knowing gall and nodded her acceptance of the
verdict. If the gall had been hidden by the upper lobe of the liver,
the verdict would not have been sustained.</p>
<p>If a person steals palay, the injured party may take a sementera
from the offender.</p>
<p>If a man is found stealing pine wood from the forest lands of
another, he forfeits not only all the wood he has cut but also his
working ax.</p>
<p>The penalty for the above two crimes is common knowledge, and if the
crime is proved there is no longer need for the old men to make a
decision&mdash;the offended party takes the customary retributive
action against the offender.</p>
<p>Cases of assault and battery frequently occur. The chief causes are
lovers&rsquo; jealousies, theft of irrigating water during a period of
drought, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6637" href="#xd21e6637"
name="xd21e6637">170</a>]</span>and dissatisfaction between the heirs
of a property at or shortly following the time of inheritance.</p>
<p>It is customary for the old men of the interested ato to consider
all except common offenses unless the parties settle their differences
without appeal.</p>
<p>A fine of chickens, pigs, sementeras, sometimes even of carabaos, is
the usual penalty for assault and battery.</p>
<p>Adultery is not a common crime. I was unable to learn that the
punishment for adultery was ever the subject for a council of the old
men. It seems rather that the punishment&mdash;death of the
offenders&mdash;is always administered naturally, being prompted by
shocked and turbulent emotions rather than by a council of the wise
men. In Igorot society the spouse of either criminal may take the lives
of both the guilty if they are apprehended in the crime. To-day the
group consciousness of the penalty for adultery is so firmly fixed that
adulterers are slain, not necessarily on the spur of the moment of a
suspected crime but sometimes after carefully laid plans for detection.
A case in question occurred in Suyak of Lepanto Province. A man knew
that his faithless wife went habitually at dusk with another man to a
secluded spot under a fallen tree. One evening the husband preceded
them, and lay down with his spear on the tree trunk. When the guilty
people arrived he killed them both in their crime, thrusting his spear
through them and pinning them to the earth.</p>
<p>Among a primitive people whose warfare consists much in ambushing
and murdering a lone person it is not always possible to predict
whether the taking of human life will be considered a criminal act or
an act of legitimate warfare.</p>
<p>It is considered warfare by the group of the murdered person, and as
such to be met by return warfare unless the group of the murderer is a
friendly one and at once comes to the offended people to sue for
continued peace. This applies to political groups within a pueblo as
well as to the people of distinct pueblos.</p>
<p>When murder is considered simply as a crime, its punishment may be
one of two classes: First, the murderer may lose his life at the hands
of his own group; second, the crime may be compounded for the
equivalent of the guilty man&rsquo;s property. In this case the
settlement is between the guilty person and the political group of the
victim, and the value of the compound is consumed by feastings of the
group. No part of the price is paid the family of the deceased as a
compensation for the loss of his labor and other assistance.</p>
<p>The three following specific cases of misdemeanors will illustrate
somewhat, more fully the nature of differences which arise between
individuals in pure Igorot society:</p>
<p>In Samoki early in November, 1902, Bisbay pawned an iron pot&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6656" href="#xd21e6656" name=
"xd21e6656">171</a>]</span>sugar boiler&mdash;to Yagao for 4 pesos. In
about two months, when sugar season was on, Bisbay went to redeem his
property, but Yagao would neither receive the money nor give up the
boiler. The old men of the ato counseled together over the matter, and,
as a result, Yagao received the 4 pesos and returned the pot, and the
matter was thus amicably settled between the two.</p>
<p>Early in January, 1903, Mowigas, of the pueblo of Ganang, cut and
destroyed the grasshopper basket of Dadaag, of the pueblo of Mayinit,
and also slightly cut Dadaag with his ax, but did not attempt to kill
him. The cause of the assault was this: Mowigas had killed a chicken
and was having a ceremonial in his house at the time Dadaag passed with
his basket of grasshoppers. According to Igorot custom he should not
have taken grasshoppers past a house in which such a ceremony was being
performed. The breach made it necessary to hold another ceremony,
killing another chicken. Old men from Mayinit, the pueblo of Dadaag,
came to Ganang and told Mowigas he would have to pay 3 pesos for his
conduct, or Mayinit would come over and destroy the town. He paid the
money, whereas the basket was worth only one-sixth the price. Trouble
was thus averted, and the individuals reconciled. In this case the two
pueblos are friends, but Mayinit is much stronger than Ganang, and
evidently took advantage of the fact.</p>
<p>In January, 1903, a woman and her son, of Titipan, stole camotes of
another Titipan family. The old men of the two ato of the interested
families fined the thieves a hog. The fine was paid, and the hog eaten
by the old men of the two ato.</p>
<p>Very often the fine paid by the offender passes promptly down the
throats of the jury. However, it is the only compensation for their
services in keeping the peace of the pueblo, so they look upon it as
their rightful share&mdash;it is the &ldquo;lawyer&rsquo;s share&rdquo;
with a vengeance.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter VI</h2>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">War and Head-Hunting</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">En-fa-lok&prime;-n&#277;t is the Bontoc word for war,
but the expression &ldquo;na-ma&prime;-ka&rdquo;&mdash;take
heads&mdash;is used interchangeably with it.</p>
<p>For unknown generations these people have been fierce head-hunters.
Nine-tenths of the men in the pueblos of Bontoc and Samoki wear on the
breast the indelible tattoo emblem which proclaims them takers of human
heads. The fawi of each ato in Bontoc has its basket containing skulls
of human heads taken by members of the ato.</p>
<p>There are several different classes of head-hunters among primitive
Malayan peoples, but the continuation of the entire practice is
believed to be due to the so-called &ldquo;debt of
life&rdquo;&mdash;that is, each group of people losing a head is in
duty and honor bound to cancel the score by securing a head from the
offenders. In this way the score is never ended or canceled, since one
or the other group is always in debt.</p>
<p>It seems not improbable that the heads may have been cut off first
as the best way of making sure that a fallen enemy was certainly slain.
The head was at all events the best proof to a man&rsquo;s tribesmen of
the discharge of the debt of life; it was the trophy of success in
defeating the foe. Whatever the cause of taking the head may have been
with the first people, it would surely spread to others of a similar
culture who warred with a head-taking tribe, as they would wish to
appear as cruel, fierce, and courageous as the enemy.</p>
<p>Henry Ling Roth<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6677src" href=
"#xd21e6677" name="xd21e6677src">1</a> quotes Sir Spencer St. John as
follows concerning the Seribas Dyaks of Borneo (p. 142):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A certain influential man denied that head-hunting is
a religious ceremony among them. It is merely to show their bravery and
manliness, that it may be said that so-and-so has obtained heads. When
they quarrel it is a constant phrase, &ldquo;How many heads did your
father or grandfather get?&rdquo; If less than his own number,
&ldquo;Well, then, you have no occasion to be proud!&rdquo;
<span class="corr" title="Source: That">Thus</span> the possession of
heads gives them great considerations as warriors and men of wealth,
the skulls being prized as the most valuable of goods.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6687" href="#xd21e6687" name=
"xd21e6687">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again he quotes St. John (p. 143):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Feasts in general are: To make their rice grow well,
to cause the forest to abound with wild animals, to enable their dogs
and snares to be successful in securing game, to have the streams swarm
with fish, to give health and activity to the people themselves, and to
insure fertility to their women. All these blessings the possessing and
feasting of a fresh head are supposed to be the most efficient means of
securing.</p>
</div>
<p>He quotes Axel. Dalrymple as follows (p. 141)</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The Uru Ais believe that the persons whose heads they
take will become their slaves in the next world.</p>
</div>
<p>On the same page he quotes others to the same point regarding other
tribes of Borneo.</p>
<p>Roth states (p. 163):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">From all accounts there can be little doubt that one
of the chief incentives to getting heads is the desire to please the
women. It may not always have been so and there may be and probably is
the natural blood-thirstiness of the animal in man to account for a
great deal of the head-taking.</p>
</div>
<p>He quotes Mrs. F. F. McDougall in her statement of a Sakaran legend
of the origin of head-taking to the effect that the daughter of their
great ancestor residing near the Evening Star &ldquo;refused to marry
until her betrothed brought her a present worth her acceptance.&rdquo;
First the young man killed a deer which the girl turned from with
disdain; then he killed and brought her one of the great monkeys of the
forest, but it did not please her. &ldquo;Then, in a fit of despair,
the lover went abroad and killed the first man he met, and, throwing
his victim&rsquo;s head at the maiden&rsquo;s feet, he exclaimed at the
cruelty she had made him guilty of; but, to his surprise, she smiled
and said that now he had discovered the only gift worthy of
herself&rdquo; (p. 163). In the three following pages of his book the
author quotes three or four other writers who cite in detail instances
wherein heads were taken simply to advance the slayer&rsquo;s interests
with women.</p>
<p>As showing the passion for head-hunting among these people, St. John
tells of a young man who, starting alone to get a head from a
neighboring tribe, took the head of &ldquo;an old woman of their own
tribe, not very distantly related to the young fellow himself.&rdquo;
When the fact was discovered &ldquo;he was only fined by the chief of
the tribe and the head taken from him and buried&rdquo; (p. 161).</p>
<p>Again (p. 159):</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The maxim of the ruffians (Kayans) is that out of
their own country all are fair game. &ldquo;Were we to meet our father,
we would slay him.&rdquo; The head of a child or of a woman is as
highly prized as that of a man.</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Roth writes that Mr. F. Witti &ldquo;found that the latter
(Limberan) would not count as against themselves heads obtained on
head-hunting excursions, but only those of people who had been making
peaceful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6724" href="#xd21e6724"
name="xd21e6724">174</a>]</span>visits, etc. In fact, the sporting
head-hunter bags what he can get, his declared friends alone
excepted&rdquo; (p. 160).</p>
<p>The Ibilao of Luzon, near Dupax, of the Province of Nueva Vizcaya,
give the name &ldquo;debt of life&rdquo; to their head-hunting
practice; but they have, in addition, other reasons for head taking. No
man may marry who has not first taken a head; and every year after they
harvest their palay the men go away for heads, often going journeys
requiring a month of time in order to strike a particular group of
enemies. The Christians of Dupax claim that in 1899 the Ibilao took the
heads of three Dupax women who were working in the rice sementeras
close to the pueblo. These same Christians also claim that they have
seen a human head above the stacks of harvested Ibilao palay; and they
claim the custom is practiced annually, though the Ibilao deny it.</p>
<p>Some dozen causes for head-hunting among primitive Malayan peoples
have been here cited. These include the debt of life, requirements for
marriage, desire for abundant fruitage and harvest of cultivated
products, the desire to be considered brave and manly, desire for
exaltation in the minds of descendants, to increase wealth, to secure
abundance of wild game and fish, to secure general health and activity
of the people, general favor at the hands of the women, fecundity of
women, and slaves in the future life.</p>
<p>From long continuance in the practice of head-hunting, many beliefs
and superstitions arise to foster it, until in the minds of the people
these beliefs are greater factors in its perpetuation than the original
one of the debt of life. The possession of a head, with the
accompanying honor, feasts, and good omens, seems in many cases to be
of first importance rather than the avenging of a life.</p>
<p>The custom of head taking came with the Igorot to Luzon, a custom of
their ancestors in some earlier home. The people of Bontoc, however,
say that their god, Lumawig, taught them to go to war. When, a very
long time ago, he lived in Bontoc, he asked them to accompany him on a
war expedition to Lagod, the north country. They said they did not wish
to go, but finally yielded to his urgings and followed him. On the
return trip the men missed one of their companions,
Gu-ma&prime;-n&ucirc;b. Lumawig told them that Gu-ma&prime;-n&ucirc;b
had been killed by the people of the north. And thus their wars
began&mdash;Gu-ma&prime;-n&ucirc;b must be avenged. They have also a
legend in regard to head taking: The Moon, a woman called
&ldquo;Kabigat,&rdquo; was sitting one day making a copper pot, and one
of the children of the man Chalchal, the Sun, came to watch her. She
struck him with her molding paddle, cutting off his head. The Sun
immediately appeared and placed the boy&rsquo;s head back on his
shoulders. Then the Sun said to the Moon: &ldquo;Because you cut off my
son&rsquo;s head, the people of the Earth are cutting off each
other&rsquo;s heads, and will do so hereafter.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6734" href="#xd21e6734" name=
"xd21e6734">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the Bontoc men the taking of heads is not the passion it seems
to be with some of the people of Borneo. It, is, however, the almost
invariable accompaniment of their interpueblo warfare. They invariably,
too, take the heads of all killed on a head-hunting expedition. They
have skulls of Spaniards, and also skulls of Igorot, secured when on
expeditions of punishment or annihilation with the Spanish
soldiers.</p>
<p>But the possession of a head is in no way a requisite to marriage. A
head has no part in the ceremonies for palay fruitage and harvest, or
in any of the numerous agricultural or health ceremonies of the year.
It in no way affects a man&rsquo;s wealth, and, so far as I have been
able to learn, it in no way affects in their minds a man&rsquo;s future
existence. A beheaded man, far from being a slave, has special honor in
the future state, but there seems to be none for the head taker. As
shown by the Lumawig legend the debt of life is the primary cause of
warfare in the minds of the people of Bontoc, and it is to-day a
persistent cause. Moreover, since interpueblo warfare exists and head
taking is its form, head-hunting is a necessity with an individual
group of people in a state of nature. Without it a people could have no
peace, and would be annihilated by some group which believed it a
coward and an easy prey.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the desire to be considered brave and manly
has come to be a factor in Bontoc head taking. In my presence an Igorot
once told a member of ato Ungkan that the men of his ato were like
girls, because they had not taken heads. The statement was false, but
the pronounced judgment sincere. In this connection, also, it may be
said that although the taking of a head is not a requisite to marriage,
and they say that it does not win the men special favor from the women,
yet, since it makes them manly and brave in the eyes of their fellows,
it must also have its influence on the women.</p>
<p>The desire for exaltation in the minds of descendants also has a
certain influence&mdash;young men in quarrels sometimes brag of the
number of heads taken by their ancestors, and the prowess or success of
an ancestor seems to redound to the courage of the descendants; and it
is an affront to purposely and seriously belittle the head-hunting
results of a man&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that head-hunting expeditions are often made
in response to a desire for activity and excitement, with all the
feasting, dancing, and rest days that follow a successful foray. The
explosive nature of a man&rsquo;s emotional energy demands this
bursting of the tension of everyday activities. In other words, the
people get to itching for a head, because a head brings them emotional
satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is believed that now the people of the two sister pueblos, Bontoc
and Samoki, look on war and head-hunting somewhat as a game, as a
dangerous, great sport, though not a pastime. It is a test of agility
and skill, in which superior courage and brute force are minor factors.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6748" href="#xd21e6748" name=
"xd21e6748">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>Primarily a pueblo is an enemy of every other pueblo, but it is
customary for pueblos to make terms of peace. Neighboring pueblos are
usually, but not always, friendly. The second pueblo away is usually an
enemy. On most of our trips through northern Luzon cargadors and guides
could readily be secured to go to the nearest pueblo, but in most cases
they absolutely refused to go on to the second pueblo, and could seldom
be driven on by any argument or force. The actual negotiations for
peace are generally between some two ato of the two interested pueblos,
since the debt of life is most often between two ato.</p>
<p>Bontoc and Samoki claim never to have sued for peace&mdash;a
statement probably true, as they are by far the largest body of
warriors in the culture area, and their war reputation is the worst.
When one ato agrees on peace with another the entire pueblo honors the
treaty.</p>
<p>The following peace agreements have been sought by outside pueblos
in recent years of the following ato of Bontoc: Sakasakan sued for
peace from Somowan, and Barlig from Pudpudchog; Tulubin, from
Buyayyeng; Bitwagan, from Sipaat; Tukukan sought peace from both Amkawa
and Polupo, and Sabangan also from Polupo; Sadanga, from Choko; and
Baliwang, from Longfoy.</p>
<p>The relations with two of these pueblos, Barlig and Sadanga,
however, are now not peaceful. Bontoc has many kin in Lias, some two
days to the east, the trail to which passes Barlig; but communication
between these pueblos of kin has ceased, because of the attitude of
Barlig. Communication between Bontoc and Tinglayan, northeast of the
Bontoc area on the river, has also ceased, because of the enmity of
Sadanga, which lies close to the trail between the two pueblos.</p>
<p>The peace ceremonial, to which a hog or carabao is brought by the
entreating people and eaten by the two parties to the agreement, is
called &ldquo;pwi-d&#301;n.&rdquo; The peace is sealed by some
exchange, as of a battle-ax for a blanket, the people sued having the
better part of the trade.</p>
<p>It now and then happens that of two pueblos at peace one loses a
head to the other. If the one taking the head desires continued peace,
some of its most influential men hasten to the other pueblo to talk the
matter over. Very likely the other pueblo will say, &ldquo;If you wish
war, all right; if not, you bring us two carabaos, and we will still be
friends.&rdquo; If no effort for peace is made by the offenders, each
from that day considers the other an enemy.</p>
<p>There is a formal way of breaking the peace between two pueblos:
Should ato Somowan of Bontoc, for instance, wish to break her peace
with Sakasakan she holds a ceremonial meeting, called
&ldquo;m&#277;n-pa-k&#277;l&prime;.&rdquo; In this meeting the old men
freely speak their minds; and when all matters are settled a messenger
departs for Sakasakan bearing a battle-ax <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6763" href="#xd21e6763" name="xd21e6763">177</a>]</span>or
spear&mdash;the customary token of war with all these Bontoc peoples.
The life of the war messenger is secure, but, if possible, he is a
close relative of the challenged people. There is no record that such a
person was ever killed while on his mission. The messenger presents
himself to some old man of the ato or pueblo, and says,
&ldquo;In-ya&prime;-lak nan sud-sud in-fu-sul&prime;-ta-ko,&rdquo;
which means, roughly, &ldquo;I bring the challenge of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the challenge is accepted, as it usually is, an ax or spear is
given the messenger, and he hastens home to exclaim to his people,
&ldquo;&#300;n-tang-i&prime;-cha
m&#277;n-fu-sul&prime;-ta-ko&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;They care to
contest in war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A peace thus canceled is followed by a battle between practically
all the men of both sides. It is customary for the challenging people,
within a few days, to appear before the pueblo of their late friends,
and the men at once come out in answer to the challenging cries of the
visitors&mdash;&ldquo;Come out if you dare to fight us?&rdquo; Or it
may he that those challenged appear near the other pueblo before it has
time to back its challenge.</p>
<p>If the challenged pueblo does not wish to fight, the spokesman tells
the messenger that they do not wish war; they desire continued
friendship; and the messenger returns to his people, not with a weapon
of war, but with a chicken or a pig; and he repeats to his people the
message he received from the old man.</p>
<p>After a peace has been canceled the two pueblos keep up a predatory
warfare, with a head lost here and there, and with now and then a more
serious battle, until one or the other again sues for peace, and has
its prayer granted. In this predatory warfare the entire body of
enemies, one or more ato, at times lays in hiding to take a few heads
from lone people at their daily toil. Or when the country about a trail
is covered with close tropical growth an enemy may hide close above the
path and practically pick his man as he passes beneath him. He hurls or
thrusts his spear, and almost always escapes with his own life,
frequently bursting through a line of people on the trail, and
instantly disappearing in the cover below. Should the injured pueblo
immediately retaliate, it finds its enemies alert and on guard.</p>
<p>At two places near the mountain trail between Samoki and Tulubin is
a trellis-like structure called &ldquo;ko&prime;-m&#301;s.&rdquo; It
consists of several posts set vertically in the ground, to which
horizontal poles are tied, The posts are the stem and root sections of
the beautiful tree ferm. They are set root end up, and the fine, matted
rootlets present a compact surface which the Igorot has carved in the
traditional shape of the &ldquo;anito.&rdquo; Some of these heads have
inlaid eyes and teeth of stone. Hung on the ko&prime;-m&#301;s are
baskets and frames in which chickens and pigs have been carried to the
place for ceremonial feasting.</p>
<p>These two ko&prime;-m&#301;s were built four years ago when Bontoc
and Samoki <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6778" href="#xd21e6778"
name="xd21e6778">178</a>]</span>had their last important head-hunting
forays with Tulubin. When Bontoc or Samoki (and usually they fight
together) sought Tulubin heads they spent a night at one of the
ko&prime;-m&#301;s, remaining at the first one, if the signs were
propitious&mdash;but, if not, they passed on to the second, hoping for
better success. They killed and ate their fowls and pigs in a ceremony
called &ldquo;fi-kat&prime;,&rdquo; and, if all was well, approached
the mountains near Tulubin and watched to waylay a few of her people
when they came to the sementeras in the early morning. If a crow flew
cawing over the trail, or a snake or rat crossed before the warriors,
or a rock rolled down the mountain side, or a clod of earth caved away
under their feet, or if the little omen bird,
&ldquo;i&prime;-chu,&rdquo; called, the expedition was abandoned, as
these were bad omens.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the ko&prime;-m&#301;s is held before all
head-hunting expeditions, except in the unpremeditated outburst of a
people to immediately punish the successful foray or ambush of some
other. The ko&prime;-m&#301;s is built along all Bontoc war trails,
though no others are known having the &ldquo;anito&rdquo; heads. So
persistent are the warriors if they have decided to go to a particular
pueblo for heads that they often go day after day to the
ko&prime;-m&#301;s for eight or ten days before they are satisfied that
no good omens will come to them. If the omens are persistently bad, it
is customary for the warriors to return to their ato and hold the
mo-g&#301;ng ceremony, during which they bury under the stone pavement
of the fawi court one of the skulls then preserved in the ato.</p>
<p>In this way they explode their extra emotions and partially work off
their disappointment.</p>
<p>Occasionally a town has a bad strain of blood, and two or three men
break away without common knowledge and take heads. The entire body of
warriors in the pueblo where those murdered lived promptly rises and
pours itself unheralded on the pueblo of the murderers. If these people
are not warned the slaughter is terrible&mdash;men, women, and children
alike being slain. None is spared, except mere babes, unless they
belong to the offended pueblo, marriage having taken them away from
home. Preceding a known attack on a pueblo it is customary for the
women and children to flee to the mountains, taking with them the dogs,
pigs, chickens, and valuable household effects. However, Bontoc pueblo,
because of her strength, is not so evacuated&mdash;she expects no enemy
strong enough to burst through and reach the defenseless.</p>
<p>In the Banawi area, where the dwellings are built on prominences
frequently <span class="measure" title="30 or more meters">a hundred or
more feet</span> above the surrounding territory, they say the women
often remain and assist in the defense by hurling rocks. They are safer
there than they would be elsewhere.</p>
<p>Men go to war armed with a wooden shield, a steel battle-ax, and one
to three steel or wooden spears. It is a man&rsquo;s agility and skill
in keeping his shield between himself and the enemy that preserves his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6793" href="#xd21e6793" name=
"xd21e6793">179</a>]</span>life. Their battles are full of quick,
incessant springing motion. There are sudden rushes and retreats,
sneaking flank movements to cut an enemy off. The body is always in
hand, always in motion, that it may respond instantly to every
necessity. Spears are thrown with greatest accuracy and fatality up to
<span class="measure" title="10 meters">30 feet</span>, and after the
spears are discharged the contest, if continued, is at arms&rsquo;
length with the battle-axes. In such warfare no attitude or position
can safely be maintained except for the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Challenges and bluffs are sung out from either side, and these
bluffs are usually &ldquo;called.&rdquo; In the last Bontoc-Tulubin
foray a fine, strapping Tulubin warrior sung out that he wanted to
fight ten men&mdash;he was taken at his word so suddenly that his head
was a Bontoc prize before his friends could rally to assist him.</p>
<p>In March we were returning from a trip to Banawi of the Quiangan
area, and were warned we might be attacked near a certain river. As we
approached it coming down a forested mountain side three or four men
were seen among the trees on the farther side of the stream. Presently
they called their dogs, which began to bark; then our Bontoc Igorot
Constabulary escort &ldquo;joshed&rdquo; the supposed enemy by loudly
caning dogs and hogs. Presently the calls worked themselves into a
rhythmic chorus for all like a strong college yell, &ldquo;A&prime;-su,
a&prime;-su, a&prime;-su, a&prime;-su, fu&prime;-tug, fu&prime;-tug,
fu&prime;-tug, fu&prime;-tug.&rdquo; It is probable the men across the
river were hunting wild hogs, but at the time the Constabulary
considered the dog calls simply a bluff, which they
&ldquo;called&rdquo; in the only way they could as they continued down
the mountain trail.</p>
<p>Rocks are often thrown in battle, and not infrequently a man&rsquo;s
leg is broken or he is knocked senseless by a rock, whereupon he loses
his head to the enemy, unless immediately assisted by his friends.</p>
<p>There is little formality about the head taking. Most heads are cut
off with the battle-ax before the wounded man is dead. Not infrequently
two or more men have thrown their spears into a man who is disabled. If
among the number there is one who has never taken a head, he will
generally be allowed to cut this one from the body, and thus be
entitled to a head taker&rsquo;s distinct tattoo. However, the head
belongs to the man who threw the first disabling spear, and it finds
its resting place in his ato. If there is time, men of other ato may
cut off the man&rsquo;s hands and feet to be displayed in their ato.
Sometimes succeeding sections of the arms and legs are cut and taken
away, so only the trunk is left on the field.</p>
<p>Frequently a battle ends when a single head is taken by either
side&mdash;the victors calling out, &ldquo;Now you go home, and we will
go home; and if you want to fight some other day, all right!&rdquo; In
this way battles are ended in an hour or so, and often in half an hour.
However, they have battles lasting half a day, and ten or a dozen heads
are taken. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6809" href="#xd21e6809"
name="xd21e6809">180</a>]</span>Seven pueblos of the lower Quiangan
region went against the scattered groups of dwellings in the Banawi
area of the upper Quiangan region in May, 1902. The invaders had seven
guns, but the people of Banawi had more than sixty&mdash;a fact the
invaders did not know until too late. However, they did not retire
until they had lost a hundred and fifty heads. They annihilated one of
the groups of the enemy, getting about fifty heads, and burned down the
dwellings. This is by far the fiercest Igorot battle of which there is
any memory, and its ferocity is largely due to firearms.</p>
<p>When a head has been taken the victor usually starts at once for his
pueblo, without waiting for the further issue of the battle. He brings
the head to his ato and it is put in a small funnel-shaped receptacle,
called &ldquo;sak-o&prime;-long,&rdquo; which is tied on a post in the
stone court of the fawi. The entire ato joins in a ceremony for the day
and night; it is called &ldquo;se&prime;-dak.&rdquo; A dog or hog is
killed, the greater part of which is eaten by the old men of the ato,
while the younger men dance to the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: rythmic">rhythmic</span> beats of the gangsa. On the next day,
&ldquo;chao&prime;-is,&rdquo; a month&rsquo;s ceremony, begins. About 7
o&rsquo;clock in the morning the old men take the head to the river.
There they build a fire and place the head beside it, while the other
men of the ato dance about it for an hour. All then sit down on their
haunches facing the river, and, as each throws a small pebble into the
water he says, &ldquo;Man-i&prime;-su, hu! hu! hu!
Tukukan!&rdquo;&mdash;or the name of the pueblo from which the head was
taken. This is to divert the battle-ax of their enemy from their own
necks. The head is washed in the river by sousing it up and down by the
hair; and the party returns to the fawi where the lower jaw is cut from
the head, boiled to remove the flesh, and becomes a handle for the
victor&rsquo;s gangsa. In the evening the head is buried under the
stones of the fawi.</p>
<p>In a head ceremony which began in Samoki May 21, 1903, there was a
hand, a jaw, and an ear suspended from posts in the courts of ato
Nag-pi&prime;, Ka&prime;-wa, and Nak-a-wang&prime;, respectively. In
each of the eight ato of the pueblo the head ceremony was performed. In
their dances the men wore about their necks rich strings of native
agate beads which at other dances the women usually wear on their
heads. Many had boar-tusk armlets, some of which were gay with tassels
of human hair. Their breechcloths were bright and long. All wore their
battle-axes, two of which were freshly stained halfway up the blade
with human blood&mdash;they were the axes used in severing the trophies
from the body of the slain.</p>
<p>On the second day the dance began about 4 o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, at which time a bright, waning moon flooded the pueblo with
light. At every ato the dance circle was started in its swing, and
barely ceased for a month. A group of eight or ten men formed, as is
shown in <a href="#pl131">Pl. CXXXI</a>, and danced contraclockwise
around and around the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6823" href=
"#xd21e6823" name="xd21e6823">181</a>]</span>small circle. Each dancer
beat his blood and emotions into sympathetic rhythm on his gangsa, and
each entered intently yet joyfully into the spirit of the
occasion&mdash;they had defeated an enemy in the way they had been
taught for generations.</p>
<p>It was a month of feasting and holidays. Carabaos, hogs, dogs, and
chickens were killed and eaten. No work except that absolutely
necessary was performed, but all people&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;gathered at the ato dance grounds and were joyous
together.</p>
<p>Each ato brought a score of loads of palay, and for two days women
threshed it out in a long wooden trough for all to eat in a great
feast. This ceremonial threshing is shown in <a href="#pl132">Pl.
CXXXII</a>. Twenty-four persons, usually all women, lined up along each
side of the trough, and, accompanying their own songs by rhythmic
beating of their pestles on the planks strung along the sides of the
trough, each row of happy toilers alternately swung in and out, toward
and from the trough, its long heavy pestles rising and falling with the
regular &ldquo;click, click, thush; click, click, thush!&rdquo; as they
fell rebounding on the plank, and were then raised and thrust into the
palay-filled trough.</p>
<p>After heads have been taken by an ato any person of that
ato&mdash;man, woman, or child&mdash;may be tattooed; and in Bontoc
pueblo they maintain that tattooing may not occur at any other time,
and that no person, unless a member of the successful ato, may be
tattooed.</p>
<p>After the captured head has been in the earth under the fawi court
of Bontoc about three years it is dug up, washed in the river, and
placed in the large basket, the so-lo&prime;-nang, in the fawi, where
doubtless it is one of several which have a similar history. At such
time there is a three-day&rsquo;s ceremony, called
&ldquo;m&#301;n-pa-fa&prime;-kal &#301;s nan
mo&prime;-k&#301;ng.&rdquo; It is a rest period for the entire pueblo,
with feasting and dancing, and three or four hogs are killed. The women
may then enter the fawi; it is said to be the only occasion they are
granted the privilege.</p>
<p>In the fawi of ato Sigichan there are at present three skulls of men
from Sagada, one of a man from Balugan, and one of a man and two of
women from Baliwang. Probably not more than a dozen skulls are kept in
a fawi at one time. The final resting place of the skull is again under
the stones of the fawi. Samoki does not keep the skull at all; it
remains where buried under the ato court. As was stated before, a skull
is generally buried under the stones of the fawi court whenever the
omens are such that a proposed head-hunting expedition is given up.
They are doubtless, also, buried at other times when the basket in the
fawi becomes too full. Sigichan has buried twenty-eight skulls in the
memory of her oldest member&mdash;making a total of thirty-five heads
taken, say, in fifty years. Three of these were men&rsquo;s heads from
Ankiling, nine were men&rsquo;s heads from Tukukan, three were
men&rsquo;s heads from Barlig, three were men&rsquo;s heads and four
women&rsquo;s heads from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6838" href=
"#xd21e6838" name="xd21e6838">182</a>]</span>Sabangan, and six were
men&rsquo;s heads from Sadanga. During this same period Sigichan claims
to have lost one man&rsquo;s head each to Sabangan and Sadanga.</p>
<p>No small children&rsquo;s skulls can be found in Bontoc, though some
other head-hunters take the heads even of infants. In fact, the men of
Bontoc say that babes and children up to about 5 years of age are not
killed by the head-hunter. If one should take a child&rsquo;s head he
would shortly be called to fate by some watchful pinteng in language as
follows: &ldquo;Why did you take that babe&rsquo;s head? It does not
understand war. Pretty soon some pueblo will take your head.&rdquo; And
the pinteng is supposed to put it into the mind of some pueblo to get
the head of that particularly cruel man.</p>
<p>The friends of a beheaded person take his body home from the scene
of death. It remains one day sitting in the dwelling. Sometimes a head
is bought back from the victors at the end of a day, the usual price
paid being a carabao. After the body has remained one day in the
dwelling it is said to be buried without ceremony near the trail
leading to the pueblo which took the head. The following day the entire
ato has a ceremonial fishing in the river, called
&ldquo;mang-o&prime;-gao&rdquo; or &ldquo;t&#301;d-w&#301;l.&rdquo; A
fish feast follows for the evening meal. The next day the
mang-ay&prime;-yu ceremony occurs. At that time the men of the ato, go
near the place where their companion lost his head and ask the beheaded
man&rsquo;s spirit, the pinteng, to return to their pueblo.</p>
<p><a href="#pl136">Pl. CXXXVI</a> shows the burial of a beheaded
corpse in Banawi in April, 1903.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6849src"
href="#xd21e6849" name="xd21e6849src">2</a> After the head-taking the
body was set up two days under the dwelling of the dead man, and was
then carried to the mountain side in the direction of Kambulo, the
pueblo which killed the man. It was tied on a war shield and the whole
tied to a pole which was borne by two men, as is shown in <a href=
"#pl135">Pl. CXXXV</a>. The funeral procession was made up as follows:
First, four warriors proceeded, one after the other, along a narrow
path on the dike walls, each beating a slow rhythm with a stick on the
long, black, Banawi war shield, each shield, however, being striped
differently with white-earth paint. The corpse was borne next, after
which followed about a dozen more warriors, most of whom carried the
white-marked shield&mdash;an emblem of mourning.</p>
<p>About <span class="measure" title="800 meters">half a mile</span>
from the dwelling the party left the sementeras and climbed up a short,
steep ascent to a spot resembling the entrance to the earth burrow of
some giant animal, and there the strange corpse was placed on the
ground. A small group of people, including one old woman, was awaiting
the funeral party. At the back end of the burrow two men tore away the
earth and disclosed a small wall of loose <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6860" href="#xd21e6860" name="xd21e6860">183</a>]</span>stones.
These they removed and revealed a vertical entrance in the earth about
<span class="measure" title="60 centimeters">2 feet</span> high and
<span class="measure" title="75 centimeters">2&frac12; feet</span>
wide. Through this small opening one of the men crawled, and crouching
in the narrow sepulcher scraped up and threw out a few handfuls of
earth. We were told that the corpse before us was the fifth to be
placed in that old tomb, all being victims of the pueblo of Kambulo,
and four of whom were descendants of the first man buried at that
place&mdash;certainly &ldquo;blood vengeance&rdquo; with a
vengeance.</p>
<p>We were without means of understanding the two or three simple oral
ceremonies said over the body, but the woman played a part which it is
understood she does not in the Bontoc area. She carried a slender,
polished stick, greatly resembling a baton or &ldquo;swagger
stick,&rdquo; and with this stood over the gruesome body, thrusting the
stick again and again toward and close to the severed neck, meanwhile
repeating a short, low-voiced something. After the body was cut from
its shield a blanket was wrapped about it&mdash;otherwise it was nude,
save for a flayed-bark breechcloth&mdash;and it was set up in the
cramped sepulcher facing Kambulo, and sitting supported away from the
earth walls by four short wooden sticks placed upright about it. An old
bamboo-headed spear was broken in the shaft and the two sections placed
with the corpse.</p>
<p>The stones were again piled across the entrance, and when all was
closed except the place for one small stone a man gave a few farewell
thrusts through the opening with a stick, uttering at the same time a
short low sentence or two. The final stone was placed and the earth
heaped against the wall.</p>
<p>The pole to which the corpse was tied when borne to the burial was
placed horizontally before the tomb, supported with both ends resting
on the high side walls of the burrow, and on it were hung a dozen
white-bark headbands which were worn, evidently, as a mark of mourning,
by many of the men who attended the burial.</p>
<p>How long it would be, in a state of nature, before the tomb would be
required for another burial is a matter of chance, but a relative,
frequently a son, nephew, or brother of the dead man, would be expected
to avenge the dead man on the pueblo of Kambulo, with chances in favor
of success, but also with equal chances of ultimate loss of the
warrior&rsquo;s head and burial where six kinsmen had preceded him.

<p class="first">There is relatively little &ldquo;color&rdquo; in the
life of the Bontoc Igorot. In the preceding chapter reference was made
to the belief that this lack of &ldquo;color,&rdquo; the monotony of
everyday life, has to do with the continuation of head-hunting. The
life of the Igorot is somber-hued indeed as compared with that of his
more advanced neighbor, the Ilokano.</p>
<div id="xd21e6885" class="div2 section"><span class=
"pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Dress</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc Igorot is not much given to
dress&mdash;under which term are considered the movable adornments of
persons. Little effort is made by the man toward dressing the head,
though before marriage he at times wears a sprig of flowers or of some
green plant tucked in the hat at either side. The young man&rsquo;s
suklang is also generally more attractive than that of the married man.
With its side ornaments of human-hair tassels, its dog teeth, or
mother-of-pearl disks, and its red and yellow colors, it is often very
gay.</p>
<p>About one hundred and fifty men in Bontoc and Samoki own and
sometimes wear at the girdle a large <span class="measure" title=
"18-centimeter">7-inch</span> disk of mother-of-pearl shell. It is
called &ldquo;fi-k&ucirc;m&prime;,&rdquo; and its use is purely
ornamental. (See <a href="#pl080">Pls. LXXX</a> and <a href=
"#pl030">XXX</a>.) It is valued highly, and I have not known half a
dozen Igorot to part with one for any price. This shell ornament is
widespread through the country east and also south of the Bontoc area,
but nowhere is it seen plentifully, except on ceremonial
days&mdash;probably not a dozen are worn daily in Bontoc.</p>
<p>Other forms of adornment, though only a means to a permanent end,
are the ear stretchers and variety of ear plugs which are worn in a
slit in the ear lobe preparing it for the earring&mdash;the
s&#301;ng-s&#301;ng, which all hope to possess. The stretcher consists
of two short pieces of bamboo forced apart and so held by two short
crosspieces inserted between them. The bamboo ear stretcher is
generally ornamented by straight incised lines. The plugs are not all
considered decorative. Some are bunches of a vegetable pith (<a href=
"#pl138">Pl. CXXXVIII</a>), others are wads of sugar-cane <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6906" href="#xd21e6906" name=
"xd21e6906">185</a>]</span>leaves. Some, however, are wooden plugs
shaped quite like an ordinary large cork stopper of a bottle (<a href=
"#pl137">Pl. CXXXVII</a>). The outer end is often ornamented by
straight incised lines or with red seeds affixed with wax or with a
small piece of a cheap glass mirror roughly inlaid. The long ear slit
is not the end sought, because if the owner despairs of owning the
coveted earring the stretchers and plugs are eventually removed and the
slit contracts from <span class="measure" title=
"40 millimeters to 6 millimeters">an inch and one-half to a quarter of
an inch</span> or less in length. The long slit is desired because the
people consider the effect more beautiful when the ring swings and
dangles at the bottom of the pendant ear. The gold earring is the most
coveted, but a few silver and many copper rings are worn in
substitution for the gold.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6914width"><img src="images/fig08.jpg" alt=
"Metal earrings." width="397" height="111">
<p class="figureHead">Metal earrings.</p>
<p class="first">(<i>a,</i> gold; <i>b</i>, copper (both are two or
three generations old and their patterns are no longer made); <i>c</i>,
copper; <i>d,</i> silver.)</p>
</div>
<p>This is practically the extent of the everyday adornment worn by the
boys and men. Small boys sometimes wear a brass-wire bracelet; but the
brass wire, so commonly worn on the wrists, ankles, and necks of the
people east, north, and south of the Bontoc area, is not affected by
the people of Bontoc.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned, there is an unique display of dress by the
man at the head-taking ceremony of the ato, when some of the dancers
wear boar-tusk armlets, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">ab-kil&prime;</span>,&rdquo; and a boar-tusk necklace, called
&ldquo;<span lang="bo">fu-yay&prime;-ya</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The necklace quite resembles the Indian bear-claw necklace, but it
is worn with the tusks pointing away from the breast, not toward it, as
is the case with the Indian necklace. There are about six of these
necklaces in Bontoc, and it is almost impossible to buy one, but the
armlets are more plentiful. They are worn above the biceps, and some
are adorned with a tuft of hair cut from a captured head.</p>
<p>The movable adornments of the woman are very similar to those of the
man.</p>
<p>The unmarried woman wears the flowers or green sprigs in the hair,
though less often than does the man. She wears the ear stretchers, ear
plugs, and earrings exactly as he does. Probably 60 per cent of men and
women in some way dress one ear; probably half as many dress both
ears.</p>
<p>The chief adornment of the woman is her hairdress. It consists
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6950" href="#xd21e6950" name=
"xd21e6950">186</a>]</span>of strings of various beads, called
&ldquo;a-pong&prime;.&rdquo; The hair is never combed in its dressing,
except with the fingers, but the entire hair is caught at the base of
the skull and lightly twisted into a loose roll; a string of beads is
put beneath this twist at the back and carried forward across the head.
The roll is then brought to the front of the head around the left side;
at the front it is tucked forward under the beads, being thus held
tightly in place. The twist is carried around the head as far as it
will extend, and the end there tucked under the beads and thus secured.
One and not infrequently two additional strings of beads are laid over
the hair, more completely holding it in place.</p>
<p>The first string of beads placed on the head usually consists of
compact, glossy, black seeds. Frequently brass-wire rings are regularly
dispersed along the string. These beads are shown in <a href=
"#pl142">Pl. CXLII</a>. The second string, with its white,
lozenge-shaped stone beads (<a href="#pl139">Pl. CXXXIX</a>), is very
striking and attractive against the black hair. This string reaches its
perfection when it is composed solely of spherical agate beads the size
of small marbles and the longer white stone beads placed at regular
intervals among the reddish agates. It is practically impossible to
purchase these beads, since they are heirlooms. The third string is
usually of dog teeth. They are strung alternately with black seeds or
with sections of dog rib. This string is worn over the hair, running
from the forehead around the back of the head, the white teeth resting
low on the back hair, and making a very attractive adornment as they
stand, points out, against the black hair. (See <a href="#pl152">Pl.
CLII</a>.)</p>
<p>Igorot women dress their hair richly in their important ceremonials.
In an &#301;n-pug-pug&prime; ceremony of Sipaat ato in Bontoc I saw
women wearing seven strings of agate beads on their hair and about
their necks. The woman loves to show her friends her accumulated wealth
in heirlooms, and the ato or pueblo ceremonies are the most favorable
opportunities for such display. All these various hairdress beads are
of Igorot manufacture.</p>
<p>I have seen Tukukan women come to Bontoc wearing a solid diadem
about the hair. It consisted of a rattan foundation encircling the
head, covered with blackened beeswax studded with three parallel rows
of encircling bright-red seeds. It made a very striking headdress.</p>
<p>Now and then a woman is seen wearing beads around the neck, but the
Bontoc woman almost never has such adornment. They are seen frequently
in pueblos to the west, however. The beads for everyday wear are seeds
in black, brown, and gray. There is also a small, irregular,
cylindrical, wooden bead worn by the women. It is sometimes worn in
strings of three or four beads by men. I believe it is considered of
talismanic value when so worn.</p>
<p>Many women in Mayinit and some women of Bontoc wear the heirloom
girdle, called &ldquo;a-ko&prime;-san,&rdquo; made of shells and brass
wire encircling a cloth girdle (see <a href="#pl140">Pl. CXL</a>). The
cloth is made in the form of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6975"
href="#xd21e6975" name="xd21e6975">187</a>]</span>long, narrow wallet,
practically concealed at the back by the encircling wire and shells.
Within this wallet the cherished agate and white stone hairdress is
often hidden away. In Mayinit this girdle is frequently worn beneath
the skirt, when it becomes, in every essential and in the effect
produced, a bustle. I have never seen it so worn in Bontoc.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Decoration</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under this head are classed all the forms of permanent
adornment of the person.</p>
<p>First must be cited the cutting and stretching of the ear. Whereas
the long, pendant earlobe is not the end in itself, nor is the long
slit always permanent, yet the mutilation of the ear is permanent and
desired. In a great many cases the lobe breaks, and the two, and even
three, long strips of lobe hanging down seem to give their owner
certain pride. Often the lower end of one of these strips is pierced
and supports a ring. The sexes share alike in the preparation for and
the wearing of earrings.</p>
<p>The woman has a permanent decoration of the nature of the
&ldquo;switch&rdquo; of the civilized woman. The loose hair combed from
the head with the fingers is saved, and is eventually rolled with the
live hair of the head into long, twisted strings, some of which are
<span class="measure" title="25 millimeters">an inch</span> in diameter
and <span class="measure" title="almost a meter">three feet</span>
long; some women have more than a dozen of these twisted strings
attached to the scalp. This is a common, though not universal, method
of decorating the head, and the mass of lard-soaked, twisted hair
stands out prominently around the crown, held more or less in place by
the various bead hairdresses. (See <a href="#pl141">Pls. CXLI</a> and
<a href="#pl142">CXLII</a>.)</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e6998">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Tattoo</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The great permanent decoration of the Igorot is the
tattoo. As has been stated in <a href="#ch06">Chapter VI</a> on
&ldquo;War and Head-Hunting,&rdquo; all the members&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;of an ato may be tattooed whenever a head is taken
by any person of the ato. It is claimed in Bontoc that at no other time
is it possible for a person to be tattooed. But Tukukan tattooed some
of her women in May, 1903, and this in spite of the fact that no heads
had recently been taken there. However, the regulations of one pueblo
are not necessarily those of another.</p>
<p>In every pueblo, there are one or more men, called
&ldquo;bu-ma-fa&prime;-t&#277;k,&rdquo; who understand the art of
tattooing. There are two such in Bontoc&mdash;Toki, of Lowingan, and
Finumti, of Longfoy&mdash;and each has practiced his art on the other.
Finumti has his back and legs tattooed in an almost unique way. I have
seen only one other at all tattooed on the back, and then the designs
were simple. A large double scallop extends from the hip to the knee on
the outside of each of Finumti&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>The design is drawn on the skin with ink made of soot and water.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7010" href="#xd21e7010" name=
"xd21e7010">188</a>]</span>Then the tattooer pricks the skin through
the design. The instrument used for tattooing is called
&ldquo;cha-kay&prime;-yum.&rdquo; It consists of from four to ten
commercial steel needles inserted in a straight line in the end of a
wooden handle; &ldquo;cha-kay&prime;-yum&rdquo; is also the word for
needle. After the pattern is pricked in, the soot is powdered over it
and pressed in the openings; the tattooer prefers the soot gathered
from the bottom of ollas.</p>
<p>The finished tattoo is a dull, blue black in color, sometimes having
a greenish cast. A man in Tulubin has a tattoo across his throat which
is distinctly green, while the remainder of his tattoo is the common
blue black. The newly tattooed design stands out in whitish ridges, and
these frequently fester and produce a mass of itching sores lasting
about one month (see <a href="#pl147">Pl. CXLVII</a>).</p>
<p>The Igorot distinguishes three classes of tattoos: The
chak-lag&prime;, the breast tattoo of the head taker; pong&prime;-o,
the tattoo on the arms of men and women; and fa&prime;-t&#277;k, under
which name all other tattoos of both sexes are classed.
Fa&prime;-t&#277;k is the general word for tattoo, and pong&prime;-o is
the name of woman&rsquo;s tattoo.</p>
<p>It is general for boys under 10 years of age to be tattooed. Their
first marks are usually a small, <span class="measure" title=
"12-millimeter">half-inch</span> cross on either cheek or a line or
small cross on the nose. One boy in Bontoc, just at the age of puberty,
has a tattoo encircling the lower jaw and chin, a wavy line across the
forehead, a straight line down the nose, and crosses on the cheeks; but
he is the youngest person I have seen wearing the jaw tattoo&mdash;a
mark quite commonly made in Bontoc when the chak-lag&prime;, or
head-taker&rsquo;s emblem, is put on.</p>
<p>The chak-lag&prime; is the most important tattoo of the Igorot,
since it marks its wearer as a taker of at least one human head. It
therefore stands for a successful issue in the most crucial test of the
fitness of a person to contribute to the strength of the group of which
he is a unit. It no doubt gives its wearer a certain advantage in
combat&mdash;a confidence and conceit in his own ability, and, likely,
it tends to unnerve a combatant who has not the same emblem and
experience. No matter what the exact social importance or advantage may
be, it seems that every man in Bontoc who has the right to the emblem
shows his appreciation of the privilege, since nine-tenths of the men
wear the chak-lag&prime;. It consists of a series of geometric markings
running upward from the breast near each nipple and curving out on each
shoulder, where it ends on the upper arm. The accompanying plates
(<a href="#pl143">CXLIII</a> to <a href="#pl149">CXLIX</a>) give an
excellent idea of the nature and appearance of the Igorot
tattoo&mdash;of course, reproductions in color would add to the effect.
The distinctness of the markings in the photographs is about
normal.</p>
<p>The basis of the designs is apparently geometric. If the
straight-line designs originated in animal forms, they have now become
so conventional that I have not discovered their original form.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7034" href="#xd21e7034" name=
"xd21e7034">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Bontoc woman is tattooed only on the arms. This tattoo begins
close back of the knuckles on the back of the hands, and, as soon as it
reaches the wrist, entirely encircles the arms to above the elbows.
Still above this there is frequently a separate design on the outside
of the arm; it is often the figure of a man with extended arms and
sprawled legs.</p>
<p>The chak-lag&prime; design on the man&rsquo;s breast is almost
invariably supplemented by two or three sets of horizontal lines on the
biceps immediately beneath the outer end of the main design. If the
tattoo on the arms of the woman were transferred to the arms of the
man, there would seldom be an overlapping&mdash;each would supplement
the other. On the men the lines are longer and the patterns simpler
than those of the women, where the lines are more cross-hatched and the
design partakes of the nature of patch-work.</p>
<p>It was not discovered that any tattoo has a special meaning, except
the head-taker&rsquo;s emblem; and the Igorot consistently maintains
that all the others are put on simply at the whim of the wearer. The
face markings, those on the arms, the stomach, and elsewhere on the
body, are believed to be purely &aelig;sthetic. The people compare
their tattoo with the figures of an American&rsquo;s shirt or coat,
saying they both look pretty. Often a cross-hatched marking is put over
goiter, varicose veins, and other permanent swellings or enlargements.
Evidently they are believed to have some therapeutic virtue, but no
statement could be obtained to substantiate this opinion.</p>
<p>As is shown by <a href="#pl148">Pls. CXLVIII</a> and <a href=
"#pl149">CXLIX</a>, the tattoo of both Banawi men and women seems to
spring from a different form than does the Bontoc tattoo. It appears to
be a leaf, or a fern frond, but I know nothing of its origin or
meaning. There is much difference in details between the tattoos of
culture areas, and even of pueblos. For instance, in Bontoc pueblo
there is no tattoo on a man&rsquo;s hand, while in the pueblos near the
south side of the area the hands are frequently marked on the backs. In
Benguet there is a design popularly said to represent the sun, which is
seen commonly on men&rsquo;s hands. Instances of such differences could
be greatly multiplied here, but must be left for a more complete study
of the Igorot tattoo.</p>

<h3 class="main">Music</h3>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e7053">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Instrumental music</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc Igorot has few musical instruments, and all
are very simple. The most common is a gong, a flat metal drum about
<span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">1 foot</span> in diameter
and <span class="measure" title="5 centimeters">2 inches</span> deep.
This drum is commonly said to be &ldquo;brass,&rdquo; but analyses show
it to be bronze.</p>
<p>Two gongs submitted to the Bureau of Government Laboratories,
Manila, consisted, in one case, of approximately 80 per cent copper, 15
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7066" href="#xd21e7066" name=
"xd21e7066">190</a>]</span>per cent tin, and 5 per cent zinc; in the
other case of approximately 84 per cent copper, 15 per cent tin, 1 per
cent zinc, and a trace of iron.</p>
<p>Early Chinese records read that tin was one of the Chinese imports
into Manila in the thirteenth century. Copper was mined and wrought by
the Igorot when the Spaniards came to the Philippines, and they wrote
regarding it that it was then an old and established industry and art.
It may possibly be that bronze was made in the Philippines before the
arrival of the Spaniard, but there is no proof of such an
hypothesis.</p>
<p>The gong to-day enters the Bontoc area in commerce generally from
the north&mdash;from the Igorot or Tinguian of old Abra
Province&mdash;and no one in the Provinces of Benguet or Lepanto-Bontoc
seems to know its source. Throughout the Archipelago and southward in
Borneo there are metal drums or &ldquo;gongs&rdquo; apparently of
similar material but of varying styles. It is commonly claimed that
those of the Moro are made on the Asiatic mainland. It is my opinion
that the Bontoc gong, or gang&prime;-sa, originates in China, though
perhaps it is not now imported directly from there. It certainly does
not enter the Island of Luzon at Manila, or Candon in Ilokos Sur, and,
it is said, not at Vigan, also in Ilokos Sur.</p>
<p>In the Bontoc area there are two classes of gang&prime;-sa; one is
called ka&prime;-los, and the other co-ong&prime;-an. The
co-ong&prime;-an is frequently larger than the other, seems to be
always of thicker metal, and has a more bell-like and usually
higher-pitched tone. I measured several gang&prime;-sa in Bontoc and
Samoki, and find the co-ong&prime;-an about 5 millimeters thick, 52 to
55 millimeters deep, and from 330 to 360 millimeters in diameter; the
ka&prime;-los is only about 2 to 3 millimeters thick. The Igorot
distinguishes between the two very quickly, and prizes the
co-ong&prime;-an at about twice the value of the ka&prime;-los. Either
is worth a large price to-day in the central part of the area&mdash;or
from one to two carabaos&mdash;but it is quite impossible to purchase
them even at that price.</p>
<p>Gang&prime;-sa music consists of two things&mdash;rhythm and crude
harmony. Its rhythm is perfect, but though there is an appreciation of
harmony as is seen in the recognition of, we may say, the
&ldquo;tenor&rdquo; and &ldquo;bass&rdquo; tones of co-ong&prime;-an
and ka&prime;-los, respectively, yet in the actual music the harmony is
lost sight of by the American.</p>
<p>In Bontoc the gang&prime;-sa is held vertically in the hand by a
cord passing through two holes in the rim, and the cord usually has a
human lower jaw attached to facilitate the grip. As the instrument thus
hangs free in front of the player (always a man or boy) it is beaten on
the outer surface with a short padded stick like a miniature bass-drum
stick. There is no gang&prime;-sa music without the <span class="corr"
title="Source: accompaying">accompanying</span> dance, and there is no
dance unaccompanied by music. A gang&prime;-sa or a tin can put in the
hands of an Igorot boy is always at once productive of music and dance.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7081" href="#xd21e7081" name=
"xd21e7081">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>The rhythm of Igorot gang&prime;-sa music is different from most
primitive music I have heard either in America or Luzon. The player
beats 4/4 time, with the accent on the third beat. Though there may be
twenty gang&prime;-sa in the dance circle <span class="measure" title=
"1,600 meters">a mile</span> distant, yet the regular pulse and beat of
the third count is always the prominent feature of the sound. The music
is rapid, there being from fifty-eight to sixty full 4/4 counts per
minute.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to represent Igorot music, instrumental or
vocal, in any adequate manner, but I may convey a somewhat clearer
impression of the rhythm if I attempt to represent it mathematically.
It must be kept in mind that all the gang&prime;-sa are beaten
regularly and in perfect time&mdash;there is no such thing as half
notes.</p>
<p>The gang&prime;-sa is struck at each italicized count, and each
unitalicized count represents a rest, the accent represents the
accented beat of the gang&prime;-sa. The ka&prime;-los is usually
beaten without accent and without rest. Its beats are <i>1, 2, 3, 4; 1,
2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4</i>; etc. The co-ong&prime;-an is
usually beaten with both accent and rest. It is generally as follows:
<i>1, 2, 3&prime;,</i> 4; <i>1, 2, 3&prime;, 4; 1, 2, 3&prime;,</i>
4<i>; 1, 2, 3&prime;,</i> 4; etc. Sometimes, however, only the first
count and again the first and second counts are struck on the
individual co-ong&prime;-an, but there is no accent unless the third is
struck. Thus it is sometimes as follows: <i>1</i>, 2, 3, 4; <i>1,</i>
2, 3, 4; <i>1</i>, 2, 3, 4; <i>1</i>, 2, 3, 4; etc.; and again <i>1,
2,</i> 3, 4; <i>1, 2,</i> 3, 4; <i>1, 2</i>, 3, 4; <i>1, 2</i>, 3, 4;
<i>1, 2,</i> 3, 4; etc. However, the impression the hearer receives
from a group of players is always of four rapid beats, the third one
being distinctly accented. A considerable volume of sound is produced
by the gang&prime;-sa of the central part of the area; it may readily
be heard <span class="measure" title="1&frac12; kilometer">a
mile</span>, if beaten in the open air.</p>
<p>In pueblos toward the western part of the area, as in Balili, Alap,
and their neighbors, the instrument is played differently and the sound
carries only <span class="measure" title="10 or 20 meters">a few
rods</span>. Sometimes the player sits in very un-Malayan manner, with
legs stretched out before him, and places the gang&prime;-sa bottom up
on his lap. He beats it with the flat of both hands, producing the
rhythmic pulse by a deadening or smothering of a beat. Again the
gang&prime;-sa is held in the air, usually as high as the face, and one
or two soft beats, just a tinkle, of the 4/4 time are struck on the
inside of the gang&prime;-sa by a small, light stick. Now and then the
player, after having thoroughly acquired the rhythm, clutches the
instrument under his arm for a half minute while he continues his dance
in perfect time and rhythm.</p>
<p>The lover&rsquo;s &ldquo;jews&rsquo;-harp,&rdquo; made both of
bamboo and of brass, is found throughout the Bontoc area. It is played
near to and in the olag wherein the sweetheart of the young man is at
the time. The instrument, called in Bontoc &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">ab-a&prime;-f&uuml;</span>,&rdquo; is apparently primitive
Malayan, and is found widespread in the south seas and Pacific Ocean.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7146" href="#xd21e7146" name=
"xd21e7146">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>The brass instrument, the only kind I ever saw in use except as a
semitoy in the hands of small boys, is from <span class="measure"
title="5 to 8 centimeters">2 to 3 inches</span> in length, and has a
tongue, attached at one end, cut from the middle of the narrow strip of
metal. (The Igorot make the <span lang="bo">ab-a&prime;-f&uuml;</span>
of metal cartridges.) A cord is tied to the instrument at the end at
which the tongue is attached, and this the player jerks to vibrate the
tongue. The instrument is held at the mouth, is lightly clasped between
the lips, and, as the tongue vibrates, the player breathes a low, soft
tune through the instrument. One must needs get within <span class=
"measure" title="a half or one meter">2 or 3 feet</span> of the player
to catch the music, but I must say after hearing three or four men play
by the half hour, that they produce tunes the theme of which seems to
me to bespeak a genuine musical taste.</p>
<p>I have seen a few crude bamboo flutes in the hands of young men, but
none were able to play them. I believe they are of Ilokano
introduction.</p>
<p>A long wooden drum, hollow and cannon-shaped, and often <span class=
"measure" title="a meter">3 feet</span> and more long and about
<span class="measure" title="20 centimeters">8 inches</span> in
diameter, is common in Benguet, and is found in Lepanto, but is not
found or known in Bontoc. A skin stretched over the large end of the
drum is beaten with the flat of the hands to accompany the music of the
metal drums or gang&prime;-sa, also played with the flat of the hands,
as described, in pueblos near the western border of Bontoc area.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd21e7168">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Vocal music</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot has vocal music, but in no way can I
describe it&mdash;to say nothing of writing it. I tried repeatedly to
write the words of the songs, but failed even in that. The chief cause
of failure is that the words must be sung&mdash;even the singers failed
to repeat the songs word after word as they repeat the words of their
ordinary speech. There are accents, rests, lengthened sounds, sounds
suddenly cut short&mdash;in fact, all sorts of vocal gymnastics that
clearly defeated any effort to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; the songs. I believe
many of the songs are wordless; they are mere vocalizations&mdash;the
&ldquo;tra la la&rdquo; of modern vocal music; they may be the first
efforts to sing.</p>
<p>I was told repeatedly that there are four classes of songs, and only
four. The mang-ay-u-w&#277;ng&prime;, the laborer&rsquo;s song, is sung
in the field and trail. The mang-ay-y&#277;ng&prime; is said to be the
class of songs rendered at all ceremonies, though I believe the doleful
funeral songs are of another class. The mang-ay-lu&prime;-kay and the
t&#301;ng-ao&prime; I know nothing of except in name.</p>
<p>Most of the songs seem serious. I never heard a mother or other
person singing to a babe. However, boys and young men, friends with
locked arms or with arms over shoulders, often sing happy songs as they
walk along together. They often sing in &ldquo;parts,&rdquo; and the
music <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7177" href="#xd21e7177" name=
"xd21e7177">193</a>]</span>produced by a tenor and a bass voice as they
sing their parts in rhythm, and with very apparent appreciation of
harmony, is fascinating and often very pleasing.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Dancing</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc Igorot dances in a circle, and he follows
the circle contraclockwise. There is no dancing without gang&prime;-sa
music, and it is seldom that a man dances unless he plays a
gang&prime;-sa. The dance step is slower than the beats on the
gang&prime;-sa; there is one complete &ldquo;step&rdquo; to every full
4/4 count. At times the &ldquo;step&rdquo; is simply a high-stepping
slow run, really a springing prance. Again it is a hitching movement
with both feet close to the earth, and <span class="measure" title=
"30 centimeters">one foot</span> behind the other. The line of dancers,
well shown in <a href="#pl131">Pls. CXXXI</a>, <a href=
"#pl151">CLI</a>, and <a href="#pl152">CLII</a>, passes slowly around
the circle, now and again following the leader in a spiral movement
toward the center of the circle and then uncoiling backward from the
center to the path. Now and again the line moves rapidly for half the
distance of the circumference, and then slowly backs a short distance,
and again it all but stops while the men stoop forward and crouch
stealthily along as though in ambush, creeping on an enemy. In all this
dancing there is perfect rhythm in music and movements. There is no
singing or even talking&mdash;the dance is a serious but pleasurable
pastime for those participating.</p>
<p>As is shown also by the illustrations, the women dance. They throw
their blankets about them and extend their arms, usually clutching
tobacco leaves in either hand&mdash;which are offerings to the old men
and which some old man frequently passes among them and
collects&mdash;and they dance with less movement of the feet than do
the men. Generally the toes scarcely leave the earth, though a few of
the older women invariably dance with a high movement and backward
pawing of <span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">one foot</span>
which throws the dust and gravel over all behind them. I have more than
once seen the dance circle a cloud of dust raised by one pawing woman,
and the people at the margin of the circle dodging the gravel thrown
back, yet they only laughed and left the woman to pursue her peculiar
and discomforting &ldquo;step.&rdquo; The dancing women are generally
immediately outside the circle, and from them the rhythm spreads to the
spectators until a score of women are dancing on their toes where they
stand among the onlookers, and little girls everywhere are imitating
their mothers. The rhythmic music is fascinating, and one always feels
out of place standing stiff legged in heavy, hobnailed shoes among the
pulsating, rhythmic crowd. Now and again a woman dances between two men
of the line, forcing her way to the center of the circle. She is
usually more spectacular than those about the margin, and frequently
holds in her hand her camote stick or a ball of bark-fiber thread which
she has spun <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7204" href="#xd21e7204"
name="xd21e7204">194</a>]</span>for making skirts. I once saw such a
dancer carry the long, heavy wooden pestle used in pounding out
rice.</p>
<p>A few times I have seen men dance in the center of the circle
somewhat as the women do, but with more movement, with a balancing and
tilting of the body and especially of the arms, and with rapid
trembling and quivering of the hands. The most spectacular dance is
that of the man who dances in the circle brandishing a head-ax. He is
shown in <a href="#pl152">Pls. CLII</a> and <a href="#pl153">CLIII</a>.
At all times his movements are in perfect sympathy and rhythm with the
music. He crouches around between the dancers brandishing his ax, he
deftly all but cuts off a hand here, an arm or leg there, an ear
yonder. He suddenly rushes forward and grinningly feigns cutting off a
man&rsquo;s head. He contorts himself in a ludicrous yet often fiendish
manner. This dance represents the height of the dramatic as I have seen
it in Igorot life. His is truly a mimetic dance. His colleague with the
spear and shield, who sometimes dances on the outskirts of the circle,
now charging a dancer and again retreating, also produces a true
mimetic and dramatic spectacle. This is somewhat more than can be said
of the dance of the women with the camote sticks, pestles, and spun
thread. The women in no way &ldquo;act&rdquo;&mdash;they simply
purposely present the implements or products of their labors, though in
it all we see the real beginning of dramatic art.</p>
<p>Other areas, and other pueblos also, have different dances. In the
Benguet area the musicians sit on the earth and play the gang&prime;-sa
and wooden drum while the dancers, a man and woman, pass back and forth
before them. Each dances independently, though the woman follows the
man. He is spectacular with from one to half a dozen blankets swinging
from his shoulders, arms, and hands.</p>
<p>Captain Chas. Nathorst, of Cervantes, has told me of a dance in
Lepanto, believed by him to be a funeral dance, in which men stand
abreast in a long line with arms on each other&rsquo;s shoulders. In
this position they drone and sway and occasionally paw the air with
<span class="measure" title="30 centimeters">one foot</span>. There is
little movement, and what there is is sluggish and lifeless.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cockfighting is the Philippine sport. Almost
everywhere the natives of the Archipelago have cockfights and horse
races on holidays and Sundays. They are also greatly addicted to the
sport of gambling. The Bontoc Igorot has none of the common pastimes or
games of chance. This fact is remarkable, because the modern Malayan is
such a gamester.</p>
<p>Only in toil, war, and numerous ceremonials does the Bontoc man work
off his superfluous and emotional energy. One might naturally expect to
find Jack a dull boy, but he is not. His daily round of toil seems
quite sufficient to keep the steady accumulation of energy at a natural
poise, and his head-hunting offers him the greatest game of skill and
chance which primitive man has invented. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Formalities</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot has almost no formalities, the
&ldquo;etiquette&rdquo; which one can recognize as binding
&ldquo;form.&rdquo; When the American came to the Islands he found the
Christians exceedingly polite. The men always removed their hats when
they met him, the women always spoke respectfully, and some tried to
kiss his hand. Every house, its contents and occupants, to which he
might go was his to do with as he chose. Such characteristics, however,
seem not to belong to the primitive Malayan. The Igorot meets you face
to face and acts as though he considers himself your equal&mdash;both
you and he are men&mdash;and he meets his fellows the same way.</p>
<p>When Igorot meet they do not greet each other with words, as most
modern people do. As an Igorot expressed it to me they are &ldquo;all
same dog&rdquo; when they meet. Sometimes, however, when they part, in
passing each other on the trial, one asks where the other is going.</p>
<p>The person with a load has the right of way in the trail, and others
stand aside as best they can.</p>
<p>There is commonly no greeting when a person comes to one&rsquo;s
house, nor is there a greeting between members of a family when one
returns home after an absence even of a week or more.</p>
<p>Children address their mothers as &ldquo;I&prime;-na,&rdquo; their
word for mother, and address their father as &ldquo;A&prime;-ma,&rdquo;
their word for father. They do this throughout life.</p>
<p>Igorot do not kiss or have other formal physical expression to show
affection between friends or relatives. Mothers do not kiss their babes
even.</p>
<p>The Igorot has no formal or common expression of thankfulness.
Whatever gratitude he feels must be taken for granted, as he never
expresses it in words.</p>
<p>When an Igorot desires to beckon a person to him he, in common with
the other Malayans of the Archipelago, extends his arm toward the
person with the hand held prone, not supine as is the custom in
America, and closes the hand, also giving a slight inward movement of
the hand at the wrist. This manner of beckoning is universal in
Luzon.</p>
<p>The hand is almost never used to point a direction. Instead, the
head is extended in the direction indicated&mdash;not with a nod, but
with a thrusting forward of the face and a protruding of the open lips;
it is a true lip gesture. I have seen it practically everywhere in the
Islands, among pagans, Mohammedans, and Christians.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Spirit belief</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The basis of Igorot religion is every man&rsquo;s
belief in the spirit world&mdash;the animism found widespread among
primitive peoples. It is the belief in the ever-present, ever-watchful
a-ni&prime;-to, or spirit of the dead, who has all power for good or
evil, even for life or death. In this world of spirits the Igorot is
born and lives; there he constantly entreats, seeks to appease, and to
cajole; in a mild way he threatens, and he always tries to avert; and
there at last he surrenders to the more than matchful spirits, whose
numbers he joins, and whose powers he acquires.</p>
<p>All things have an invisible existence as well as a visible,
material one. The Igorot does not explain the existence of earth,
water, fire, vegetation, and animals in invisible form, but man&rsquo;s
invisible form, man&rsquo;s spirit, is his speech. During the life of a
person his spirit is called &ldquo;ta&prime;-ko.&rdquo; After death the
spirit receives a new name, though its nature is unchanged, and it goes
about in a body invisible to the eye of man yet unchanged in appearance
from that of the living person. There seems to be no idea of future
rewards or punishments, though they say a bad a-ni&prime;-to is
sometimes driven away from the others.</p>
<p>The spirit of all dead persons is called
&ldquo;a-ni&prime;-to&rdquo;&mdash;this is the general name for the
soul of the dead. However, the spirits of certain dead have a specific
name. P&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime; is the name of the a-ni&prime;-to of a
beheaded person; wul-wul is the name of the a-ni&prime;-to of deaf and
dumb persons&mdash;it is evidently an onomatopoetic word. And wong-ong
is the name of the a-ni&prime;-to of an insane person. Fu-ta-tu is a
bad a-ni&prime;-to, or the name applied to the a-ni&prime;-to which is
supposed to be ostracized from respectable a-ni&prime;-to society.</p>
<p>Besides these various forms of a-ni&prime;-to or spirits, the body
itself is also sometimes supposed to have an existence after death.
Li-mum&prime; is the name of the spiritual form of the human body.
Li-mum&prime; is seen at times in the pueblo and frequently enters
habitations, but it is said never to cause death or accident.
Li-mum&prime; may best be translated by the English term
&ldquo;ghost,&rdquo; although he has a definite function ascribed to
the rather fiendish &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;&mdash;that of sitting
heavily on the breast and stomach of a sleeper. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7264" href="#xd21e7264" name=
"xd21e7264">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>The ta&prime;-ko, the soul of the living man, is a faithful servant
of man, and, though accustomed to leave the body at times, it brings to
the person the knowledge of the unseen spirit life in which the Igorot
constantly lives. In other words, the people, especially the old men,
dream dreams and see visions, and these form the meshes of the net
which has caught here and there stray or apparently related facts from
which the Igorot constructs much of his belief in spirit life.</p>
<p>The immediate surroundings of every Igorot group is the home of the
a-ni&prime;-to of departed members of the group, though they do not
usually live in the pueblo itself. Their dwellings, sementeras, pigs,
chickens, and carabaos&mdash;in fact, all the possessions the living
had&mdash;are scattered about in spirit form, in the neighboring
mountains. There the great hosts of the a-ni&prime;-to live, and there
they reproduce, in spirit form, the life of the living. They construct
and live in dwellings, build and cultivate sementeras, marry, and even
bear children; and eventually, some of them, at least, die or change
their forms again. The Igorot do not say how long an a-ni&prime;-to
lives, and they have not tried to answer the question of the final
disposition of a-ni&prime;-to, but in various ceremonials
a-ni&prime;-to of several generations of ancestors are invited to the
family feast, so the Igorot does not believe that the a-ni&prime;-to
ceases, as an a-ni&prime;-to, in what would be the lifetime of a
person.</p>
<p>When an a-ni&prime;-to dies or changes its form it may become a
snake&mdash;and the Igorot never kills a snake, except <span class=
"corr" title="Source: ">if</span> it bothers about his dwelling; or it
may become a rock&mdash;there is one such a-ni&prime;-to rock on the
mountain horizon north of Bontoc; but the most common form for a dead
a-ni&prime;-to to take is li&prime;-fa, the phosphorescent glow in the
dead wood of the mountains. Why or how these various changes occur the
Igorot does not understand.</p>
<p>In many respects the dreamer has seen the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: a-ni&prime;to">a-ni&prime;-to</span> world in great detail. He
has seen that a-ni&prime;-to are rich or poor, old or young, as were
the persons at death, and yet there is progression, such as birth,
marriage, old age, and death. Each man seems to know in what part of
the mountains his a-ni&prime;-to will dwell, because some one of his
ancestors is known to inhabit a particular place, and where one
ancestor is there the children go to be with him. This does not refer
to desirability of location, but simply to physical location&mdash;as
in the mountain north of Bontoc, or in one to the east or south.</p>
<p>As was stated in a previous chapter, with the one exception of
toothache, all injuries, diseases, and deaths are caused directly by
a-ni&prime;-to. In certain ceremonies the ancestral a-ni&prime;-to, are
urged to care for living descendants, to protect them from
a-ni&prime;-to that seek to harm&mdash;and children are named after
their dead ancestors, so they may be known and receive protection. In
the pueblo, the sementeras, and the mountains one knows he is always
surrounded by a-ni&prime;-to. They are ever ready to trip one up, to
push him off the high stone sementera dikes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7284" href="#xd21e7284" name=
"xd21e7284">198</a>]</span>or to visit him with disease. When one walks
alone in the mountain trail he is often aware that an a-ni&prime;-to
walks close beside him; he feels his hair creeping on his scalp, he
says, and thus he knows of the a-ni&prime;-to&rsquo;s presence. The
Igorot has a particular kind of spear, the sinalawitan, having two or
more pairs of barbs, of which the a-ni&prime;-to is afraid; so when a
man goes alone in the mountains with the sinalawitan he is safer from
a-ni&prime;-to than he is with any other spear.</p>
<p>The Igorot does not say that the entire spirit world, except his
relatives, is against him, and he does not blame the spirits for the
evils they inflict on him&mdash;it is the way things are&mdash;but he
acts as though all are his enemies, and he often entreats them to visit
their destruction on other pueblos. It is safe to say that one feast is
held daily in Bontoc by some family to appease or win the good will of
some <span lang="bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span>.</p>
<p>At death the spirit of a beheaded person, the <span lang=
"bo">p&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime;</span>, goes above to chayya, the sky.
The old men are very emphatic in this belief. They always point to the
surrounding mountains as the home of the <span lang=
"bo">a-ni&prime;-to</span>, but straight above to chayya, the sky, as
the home of the spirit of the beheaded. The old men say the <span lang=
"bo">p&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime;</span> has a head of flames. There in
the sky the <span lang="bo">p&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime;</span> repeat the
life of those living in the pueblo. They till the soil and they marry,
but the society is exclusive&mdash;there are none there except those
who lost their heads to the enemy.</p>
<p>The <span lang="bo">p&#301;n-t&#277;ng&prime;</span> is responsible
for the death of every person who loses his head. He puts murder in the
minds of all men who are to be successful in taking heads. He also sees
the outrages of warfare, and visits vengeance on those who kill babes
and small children.</p>
<p>In his relations with the unseen spirit world the Igorot has certain
visible, material friends that assist him by warnings of good and evil.
When a chicken is killed its gall is examined, and, if found to be dark
colored, all is well; if it is light, he is warned of some pending evil
in spirit form. Snakes, rats, crows, falling stones, crumbling earth,
and the small reddish-brown omen bird, <span lang=
"bo">i&prime;-chu</span>, all warn the Igorot of pending evil.</p>

<h3 class="main">Exorcist</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Since the anito is the cause of all bodily afflictions
the chief function of the person who battles for the health of the
afflicted is that of the exorcist, rather than that of the
therapeutist.</p>
<p>Many old men and women, known as &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">in-s&ucirc;p-&acirc;k&prime;</span>,&rdquo; are considered more or
less successful in urging the offending anito to leave the sick. Their
formula is simple. They place themselves near the afflicted part,
usually with the hand stroking it, or at least touching it, and say,
&ldquo;Anito, who makes this person sick, go away.&rdquo; This they
repeat over and over again, mumbling low, and frequently exhaling the
breath to assist the departure of the anito&mdash;just as, they say,
one blows away the dust; but the exhalation is an open-mouthed
outbreathing, and not a forceful blowing. One of our house boys came
home from a trip to a neighboring <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e7326" href="#xd21e7326" name="xd21e7326">199</a>]</span>pueblo
with a bad stone bruise for which an anito was responsible. For four
days he faithfully submitted to flaxseed poultices, but on the fifth
day we found a woman <span lang=
"bo">in-s&ucirc;p-&acirc;k&prime;</span> at her professional task in
the kitchen. She held the sore foot in her lap, and stroked it; she
murmured to the anito to go away; she bent low over the foot, and about
a dozen times she well feigned vomiting, and each time she spat out a
large amount of saliva. At no time could purposeful exhalations be
detected, and no explanation of her feigned vomiting could be gained.
It is not improbable that when she bent over the foot she was supposed
to be inhaling or swallowing the anito which she later sought to cast
from her. In half an hour she succeeded in &ldquo;removing&rdquo; the
offender, but the foot was &ldquo;sick&rdquo; for four days longer, or
until the deep-seated bruise discharged through a scalpel opening. The
woman unquestionably succeeded in relieving the boy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>When a person is ill at his home he sends for an <span lang=
"bo">in-s&ucirc;p-&acirc;k&prime;</span>, who receives for a
professional visit two manojos of palay, or two-fifths of a
laborer&rsquo;s daily wage. <span lang=
"bo">In-s&ucirc;p-&acirc;k&prime;</span> are not appointed or otherwise
created by the people, as are most of the public servants. They are
notified in a dream that they are to be <span lang=
"bo">in-s&ucirc;p-&acirc;k&prime;</span>.</p>
<p>As compared with the medicine man of some primitive peoples the
<span lang="bo">in-s&ucirc;p-&acirc;k&prime;</span> is a beneficial
force to the sick. The methods are all quiet and gentle; there is none
of the hubbub or noise found in the Indian lodge&mdash;the body is not
exhausted, the mind distracted, or the nerves racked. In a positive way
the sufferer&rsquo;s mind receives comfort and relief when the anito is
&ldquo;removed,&rdquo; and in most cases probably temporary, often
permanent, physical relief results from the stroking and rubbing.</p>
<p>The man or woman of each household acts as mediator between any sick
member of the family and the offending anito. There are several of
these household ceremonials performed to benefit the afflicted.</p>
<p>If one was taken ill or was injured at any particular place in the
mountains near the pueblo, the one in charge of the ceremony goes to
that place with a live chicken in a basket, a small amount of basi (a
native fermented drink), and usually a little rice, and, pointing with
a stick in various directions, says the <span lang=
"bo">Wa-chao&prime;-wad</span> or <span lang="bo">Ay&prime;-ug si
a-fi&prime;-&#301;k</span> ceremony&mdash;the ceremony of calling the
soul. It is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="bo">A-li-ka&prime; ab a-fi&prime;-&#301;k
Ba-long&prime;-long en-ta-ko&prime; &#301;s a&prime;-fong
sang&prime;-fu.</span>&rdquo; The translation is: &ldquo;Come, soul of
<span lang="bo">Ba-long&prime;-long</span>; come with us to the house
to feast.&rdquo; The belief is that the person&rsquo;s spirit is being
enticed and drawn away by an anito. If it is not called back shortly,
it will depart permanently.</p>
<p>The following ceremony, called &ldquo;<span lang=
"bo">ka-taol&prime;</span>,&rdquo; is said near the river, as the other
is in the mountains:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="bo">A-li-ka&prime; ta-&#277;n-ta-ko &#301;s
a&prime;-fong ta-ko&prime; tay la-t&#301;ng&prime;
&#301;s&prime;-na.</span>&rdquo; Freely translated this is:
&ldquo;Come, come with us into the house, because it is cold
here.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7375" href="#xd21e7375"
name="xd21e7375">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>A common sight in the Igorot pueblo or in the trails leading out is
a man or woman, more frequently the latter, carrying the small chicken
basket, the tube of basi, and the short stick, going to the river or
the mountains to perform this ceremony for the sick.</p>
<p>After either of these ceremonies the person returns to the dwelling,
kills, cooks, and, with other members of the family, eats the
chicken.</p>
<p>For those very ill and apparently about to die there is another
ceremony, called &ldquo;<span lang="bo">a&prime;-fat</span>,&rdquo; and
it never fails in its object, they affirm&mdash;the afflicted always
recovers. Property equal to a full year&rsquo;s wages is taken outside
the pueblo to the spot where the affliction was received, if it is
known, and the departing soul is invited to return in exchange for the
articles displayed. They take a large hog which is killed where the
ceremony is performed; they take also a large blue-figured
blanket&mdash;the finest blanket that comes to the pueblo&mdash;a
battle-ax and spear, a large pot of &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; meat, the
much-prized woman&rsquo;s bustle-like girdle, and, last, a live
chicken. When the hog is killed the person in charge of the ceremony
says: &ldquo;Come back, soul of the afflicted, in trade for these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All then return to the sick person&rsquo;s dwelling, taking with
them the possessions just offered to the soul. At the house they cook
the hog, and all eat of it; as those who assisted in the ceremony go to
their own dwellings they carry each a dish of the cooked pork.</p>
<p>The next day, since the afflicted person does not die, they have
another ceremony, called &ldquo;mang-mang,&rdquo; in the house of the
sick. A chicken is killed, and the following ceremonial is spoken from
the center of the house:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sick person is now well. May the food become abundant;
may the chickens, pigs, and rice fruit heads be large. Bring the
battle-ax to guard the door. Bring the winnowing tray to serve the
food; and bring the wisp of palay straw to sweep away the many words
spoken near us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For certain sick persons no ceremony is given for recovery. They are
those who are stricken with death, and the Igorot claims to know a
fatal affliction when it comes.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot has personified the forces of nature. The
personification has become a single person, and to-day this person is
one god, Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g. Over all, and eternal, so far as the
Igorot understands, is
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g&mdash;Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g, who had a part in
the beginning of all things; who came as a man to help the survivors
and perpetuators of Bontoc; who later came as a man to teach the people
whom he had befriended, and who still lives to care for them.
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g is the greatest of spirits, dwelling above in
chayya, the sky. All prayers for fruitage and increase&mdash;of men, of
animals, and of crops&mdash;all prayers for deliverance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7399" href="#xd21e7399" name=
"xd21e7399">201</a>]</span>from the fierce forces of the physical world
are made to him; and once each month the pa&prime;-tay ceremony,
entreating Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g for fruitage and health, is performed
for the pueblo group by an hereditary class of men called
&ldquo;pa&prime;-tay&mdash;a priesthood in process of development.
Throughout the Bontoc culture area Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g, otherwise
known but less frequently spoken of as Fu&prime;-ni and
Kam-bun&prime;-yan, is the supreme being. Scheerer says the Benguet
Igorot call their &ldquo;god&rdquo; Ka-bu-ni&prime;-an&mdash;the same
road as Kam-bun&prime;-yan.</p>
<p>In the beginning of all things Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g had a part. The
Igorot does not know how or why it is so, but he says that
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g gave the earth with all its characteristics, the
water in its various manifestations, the people, all animals, and all
vegetation. To-day he is the force in all these things, as he always
has been.</p>
<p>Once, in the early days, the lower lands about Bontoc were covered
with water. Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g saw two young people on top of Mount
Po&prime;-kis, north of Bontoc. They were Fa-tang&prime;-a and his
sister Fu&prime;-kan. They were without fire, as all the fires of
Bontoc were put out by the water. Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g told them to
wait while he went quickly to Mount Ka-lo-wi&prime;-tan, south of
Bontoc, for fire. When he returned Fu&prime;-kan was heavy with child.
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g left them, going above as a bird flies. Soon the
child was born, the water subsided in Bontoc pueblo, and
Fa-tang&prime;-a with his sister and her babe returned to the pueblo.
Children came to the household rapidly and in great numbers. Generation
followed generation, and the people increased wonderfully.</p>
<p>After a time Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g decided to come to help and teach
the Igorot. He first stopped on Ka-lo-wi&prime;-tan Mountain, and from
there looked over the young women of Sabangan, searching for a
desirable wife, but he was not pleased with the girls of Sabangan
because they had short hair. He next visited Alap, but the young women
of that pueblo were sickly; so he came on to Tulubin. There the
marriageable girls were afflicted with goiter. He next stopped at
Bontoc, where he saw two young women, sisters, in a garden.
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g came to them and sat down. Presently he asked why
they did not go to the house. They answered that they must work; they
were gathering beans. Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g was pleased with this, so
he picked one bean of each variety, tossed them into the
baskets&mdash;when presently the baskets were filled to the rim. He
married Fu&prime;-kan, the younger of the two industrious sisters, and
namesake of the mother of the people of Bontoc.</p>
<p>After marriage he lived at Chao&prime;-wi, in the present ato of
Sigichan, near the center of Bontoc pueblo. The large, flat stones
which were once part of Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g&rsquo;s dwelling are
still lying in position, and are shown in <a href="#pl153">Pl.
CLIII</a>.</p>
<p>Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g at times exhibited his marvelous powers. They
say he could take a small chicken, feed it a few grains of rice, and in
an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7420" href="#xd21e7420" name=
"xd21e7420">202</a>]</span>hour it would be full grown. He could fill a
basket with rice in a very few moments, simply by putting in a handful
of kernels. He could cut a stick of wood in the mountains, and with one
hand toss it to his dwelling in the pueblo. Once when out in
I-shil&prime; Mountains northeast of Bontoc, Fa-tang&prime;-a, the
brother-in-law of Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g, said to him, &ldquo;Oh, you of
no value! Here we are without water to drink. Why do you not give us
water?&rdquo; Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g said nothing, but he turned and
thrust his spear in the side of the mountain. As he withdrew the weapon
a small stream of water issued from the opening. Fa-tang&prime;-a
started to drink, but Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g said, &ldquo;Wait; the
others first; you last.&rdquo; When it came Fa-tang&prime;-a&rsquo;s
turn to drink, Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g put his hand on him as he drank
and pushed him solidly into the mountain. He became a rock, and the
water passed through him. Several of the old men of Bontoc have seen
this rock, now broken by others fallen on it from above, but the stream
of water still flows on the thirsty mountain.</p>
<p>In an isolated garden, called &ldquo;f&#301;l-lang&prime;,&rdquo;
now in ato Chakong, Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g taught Bontoc how best to
plant, cultivate, and garner her various agricultural products.
F&#301;l-lang&prime; to-day is a unique little sementera. It is the
only garden spot within the pueblo containing water. The pueblo is so
situated that irrigating water can not be run into it, but throughout
the dry season of 1903&mdash;the dryest for years in Bontoc&mdash;there
was water in at least a fourth of this little garden. There is
evidently a very small, but perpetual spring within the plat. Taro now
occupies the garden and is weeded and gathered by Na-w&#301;t&prime;,
an old man chosen by the old men of the pueblo for this office.
Na-w&#301;t&prime; maintains and the Igorot believe that the vegetable
springs up without planting. As the watering of f&#301;l-lang&prime; is
through the special dispensation of Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g, so the taro
left by him in his garden school received from him a peculiar lease of
life&mdash;it is perpetual. The people claim that all other taro beds
must be planted annually.</p>
<p>Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g showed the people how to build the fawi and
pabafunan, and with his help those of Lowingan and Sipaat were
constructed. He also told them their purposes and uses. He gave the
people names for many of the things about them; he also gave the pueblo
its name.</p>
<p>He gave them advice regarding conduct&mdash;a crude code of ethics.
He told them not to lie, because good men do not care to associate with
liars. He said they should not steal, but all people should take care
to live good and honest lives. A man should have only one wife; if he
had more, his life would soon be required of him. The home should be
kept pure; the adulterer should not violate it; all should be as
brothers.</p>
<p>As has been previously said, the people of Bontoc claim that they
did not go to war or kill before Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g came.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7430" href="#xd21e7430" name=
"xd21e7430">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>They say no Igorot ever divorced a wife who bore him a child, yet
they accuse Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g of such conduct, but apparently seek
to excuse the act by saying that at the time he was partially insane.
Fu&prime;-kan, Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g&rsquo;s wife, bore him several
children. One day she spoke very disrespectfully to him. This change of
attitude on her part somewhat unbalanced him, and he put her with two
of her little boys in a large coffin, and set them afloat on the river.
He securely fastened the cover of the coffin, and on either end tied a
dog and a cock. The coffin floated downstream unobserved as far as
Tinglayan. There the barking of the dog and the crowing of the cock
attracted the attention of a man who rushed out into the river with his
ax to secure such a fine lot of pitch-pine wood. When he struck his ax
in the wood a voice called from within, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that; I
am here.&rdquo; Then the man opened the coffin and saw the woman and
children. The man said his wife was dead, and the woman asked whether
he wanted her for a wife. He said he did, so she became his wife.</p>
<p>After a time the children wanted to return to Bontoc to see their
father. Before they started their mother instructed them to follow the
main river, but when they arrived at the mouth of a tributary stream
they became confused, and followed the river leading them to Kanyu.
There they asked for their father, but the people killed them and cut
them up. Presently they were alive again, and larger than before. They
killed them again and again. After they had come to life seven times
they were full-grown men; but the eighth time Kanyu killed them they
remained dead. Bontoc went for their bodies, and told Kanyu that,
because they killed the children of Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g, their
children would always be dying&mdash;and to-day Bontoc points to the
fewness of the houses which make up Kanyu. The bodies were buried close
to Bontoc on the west and northwest; scarcely were they interred when
trees began to grow upon and about the graves&mdash;they were the
transformed bodies of Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g&rsquo;s children. The
Igorot never cut trees in the two small groves nearby the pueblo, but
once a year they gather the fallen branches. They say that a Spaniard
once started to cut one of the trees, but he had struck only a few
blows when he was suddenly taken sick. His bowels bloated and swelled
and he died in a few minutes.</p>
<p>These two groves are called &ldquo;Pa-pa-tay&prime;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Pa-pa-tay&prime; ad So-kok&prime;,&rdquo; the latter one shown
in <a href="#pl154">Pl. CLIV</a>. Each is said to be a man, but among
some of the old men the one farthest to the north is now said to be a
woman. The reason they assign for now calling one a woman is because it
is situated lower down on the mountain than the other. They are held
sacred, and the monthly religious ceremonial of patay is observed
beneath their trees. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7441" href=
"#xd21e7441" name="xd21e7441">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>It seems that Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g soon became irritated and
jealous, because Fu&prime;-kan was the wife of another man, and he sent
word forbidding her to leave her house. About this time the warriors of
Tinglayan returned from a head-hunting expedition. When Fu&prime;-kan
heard their gongs and knew all the pueblo was dancing, she danced alone
in the house. Soon those outside felt the ground trembling. They looked
and saw that the house where Fu&prime;-kan lived was trembling and
swaying. The women hastened to unfortunate Fu&prime;-kan and brought
her out of the house. However, in coming out she had disobeyed
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g, and shortly she died.</p>
<p>Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g&rsquo;s work was ended. He took three of his
children with him to Mount Po&prime;-k&#301;s, on the northern horizon
of Bontoc, and from there the four passed above into the sky as birds
fly. His two other children wished to accompany him, but he denied them
the request; and so they left Bontoc and journeyed westward to Loko
(Ilokos Provinces) because, they said, if they remained, they would
die. What became of these two children is not known; neither is it
known whether those who went above are alive now; but
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g is still alive in the sky and is still the
friendly god of the Igorot, and is the force in all the things with
which he originally had to do.</p>
<p>Throughout the Bontoc culture area Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g is the one
and only god of the people. Many said that he lived in Bontoc, and, so
far as known, they hold the main facts of the belief in him
substantially as do the people of his own pueblo.</p>

<h3 class="main">&ldquo;Changers&rdquo; in religion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the western pueblos of Alap, Balili, Genugan,
Takong, and Sagada there has been spreading for the past two years a
changing faith. The people allying themselves with the new faith call
themselves &ldquo;Su-pa-la&prime;-do,&rdquo; and those who speak
Spanish say they are &ldquo;guardia de honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Su-pa-la&prime;-do continue to eat meat, but wash and cleanse it
thoroughly before cooking. They are said also not to hold any of the
ceremonials associated with the old faith. They keep a white flag
flying from a pole near their dwelling, or at least one such flag in
the section of the pueblo in which they reside. They also believe that
Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g will return to them in the near future.</p>
<p>A Tinguian man of the pueblo of Pay-yao&prime;, Lepanto, a short
journey from Agawa, in Bontoc, is said to be the leading spirit in this
faith of the &ldquo;guardia de honor.&rdquo; It is believed to be a
movement taking its rise from the restless Roman Catholic Ilokano of
the coast.</p>
<p>In Bontoc pueblo the thought of the return of Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g
is laughed at. The people say that if Lu-ma&prime;-w&#301;g was to
return they would know of it. However, two families in Bontoc, one that
of Finumti, the tattooer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7459"
href="#xd21e7459" name="xd21e7459">205</a>]</span>and the other that of
Kayyad, a neighbor of Finumti, have a touch of a changing faith. They
are known in Bontoc as O-lot&prime;.</p>
<p>I was not able to trace any connection between the O-lot&prime; and
the Su-pa-la&prime;-do, though I presume there is some connection; but
I learned of the O-lot&prime; only during the last few days of my stay
in Bontoc. The O-lot&prime; are said not to eat meat, not to kill
chickens, not to smoke, and not to perform any of the old ceremonies.
However, I do not believe they or in fact the Su-pa-la&prime;-do
neglect all ceremonials, because such a turning from a direct,
positive, and very active religious life to one of total neglect of the
old religious ceremonials would seem to be impossible for an otherwise
normal Igorot.</p>

<div id="xd21e7463" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Priesthood</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the belief in spirits is the basis of Igorot
religion is shown in the fact that each person or each household has
the necessary power and knowledge to intercede with the anito. No class
of persons has been differentiated for this function, excepting the
limited one of the dream-appointed insupak or anito exorcists.</p>
<p>That belief in a supreme being is a later development than the
belief in spirits is clear when the fact is known that a differentiated
class of persons has arisen whose duty it is to intercede with Lumawig
for the people as a whole.</p>
<p>This religious intercessor has few of the earmarks of a priest. He
teaches no morals or ethics, no idea of future rewards or punishments,
and he is not an idle, nonproductive member of the group. He usually
receives for the consumption of his family the food employed in the
ceremonies to Lumawig, but this would not sustain the family one week
in the fifty-two. The term &ldquo;priesthood&rdquo; is applied to these
people for lack of a better one, and because its use is sufficiently
accurate to serve the present purpose.</p>
<p>There are three classes of persons who stand between the people and
Lumawig, and to-day all hold an hereditary office. The first class is
called &ldquo;Wa-k&uuml;&prime;,&rdquo; of which there are three men,
namely, Fug-ku-so&prime;, of ato Somowan, Fang-u-wa&prime;, of ato
Lowingan, and Cho-I&ucirc;g&prime;, of ato Sigichan. The function of
these men is to decide and announce the time of all rest days and
ceremonials for the pueblo. These Wa-k&uuml;&prime; inform the old men
of each ato, and they in turn announce the days to the ato. The small
boys, however, are the true &ldquo;criers.&rdquo; They make more noise
in the evening before the rest day, crying &ldquo;T&#277;ng-ao&prime;!
whi! t&#277;ng-ao&prime;!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Rest day! hurrah! rest
day!&rdquo;), than I have heard from the pueblo at any other time.</p>
<p>The title of the second class of intercessors is
&ldquo;Pa&prime;-tay,&rdquo; of whom there are two in
Bontoc&mdash;Kad-lo&prime;-san, of ato Somowan, and
Fi&prime;-I&ucirc;g, of ato Longfoy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e7476" href="#xd21e7476" name="xd21e7476">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Pa&prime;-tay illustrate the nature of the titles borne by all
the intercessors. The title is the same as the name of the ceremony or
one of the ceremonies which the person performs.</p>
<p>Once every new moon each Pa&prime;-tay performs the pa&prime;-tay
ceremony in the sacred grove near the pueblo. This ceremony is for the
general well-being of the pueblo.</p>
<p>The third class of intercessors has duties of a two-fold nature. One
is to allay the rain and wind storms, called &ldquo;baguios,&rdquo; and
to drive away the cold; and the other is to petition for conditions
favorable to crops. There are seven of these men, and each has a
distinct title. All are apparently of equal importance to the
group.</p>
<p>Le-yod&prime;, of ato Lowingan, whose title is
&ldquo;Ka-lob&prime;,&rdquo; has charge of the ka-lob&prime; ceremony
held once or twice each year to allay the baguios. Ang&prime;-way, of
ato Somowan, whose title is &ldquo;Chi-nam&prime;-wi,&rdquo; presides
over the chi-nam&prime;-wi ceremony to drive away the cold and fog.
This ceremony usually occurs once or twice each year in January,
February, or March. He also serves once each year in the
fa-k&#301;l&prime; ceremony for rain. Cham-lang&prime;-an, of ato
Filig, has the title &ldquo;Po-chang&prime;,&rdquo; and he has one
annual ceremony for large palay. A fifth intercessor is Som-kad&prime;,
of ato Sipaat; his title is &ldquo;Su&prime;-wat.&rdquo; He performs
two ceremonies annually&mdash;one, the su&prime;-wat, for palay
fruitage, and the other a fa-k&#301;l&prime; for rains.
Ong-i-yud&prime;, of ato Fatayyan, is known by the title of
&ldquo;Ke&prime;-&#277;ng.&rdquo; He has two ceremonies annually, one
ke&prime;-&#277;ng and the other tot-o-lod&prime;; both are to drive
the birds and rats from the fruiting palay. Som-kad&prime;, of ato
Sigichan, with the title &ldquo;O-ki-ad&prime;,&rdquo; has charge of
three ceremonies annually. One is o-ki-ad&prime;, for the growth of
beans; another is los-kod&prime;, for abundant camotes, and the third
is fa-k&#301;l&prime;, the ceremony for rain. There are four annual
fa-k&#301;l&prime; ceremonies, and each is performed by a different
person.</p>

<h3 class="main">Sacred days</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">T&#277;ng-ao&prime; is the sacred day, the rest day,
of Bontoc. It occurs on an average of about every ten days throughout
the year, though there appears to be no definite regularity in its
occurrence. The old men of the two ato of Lowingan and Sipaat determine
when t&#277;ng-ao&prime; shall occur, and it is a day observed by the
entire pueblo.</p>
<p>The day is publicly announced in the pueblo the preceding evening.
If a person goes to labor in the fields on a sacred day&mdash;not
having heard the announcement, or in disregard of it&mdash;he is fined
for &ldquo;breaking the Sabbath.&rdquo; The old men of each ato
discover those who have disobeyed the pueblo law by working in the
field, and they announce the names to the old men of Lowingan and
Sipaat, who promptly take from the lawbreaker firewood or rice or a
small chicken to the value of about 10 cents, or the wage of two days.
March 3, 1903, was t&#277;ng-ao&prime; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

in buying chickens and pigs for the pa&prime;-tay ceremonies of the
pueblo.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ceremonials</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A residence of five months among a primitive people
about whom no scientific knowledge existed previously is evidently so
scant for a study of ceremonial life that no explanation should be
necessary here. However, I wish to say that no claim is made that the
following short presentation is complete&mdash;in fact, I know of
several ceremonies by name about which I can not speak at all with
certainty. Time was also insufficient to get accurate translations of
all ceremonial utterances which are here presented.</p>
<p>There is great absence of formalism in uttering ceremonies, scarcely
two persons speak exactly the same words, though I believe the purport
of each ceremony, as uttered by two people, to be the same. This
looseness may be due in part to the absence of a developed cult having
the ceremonies in charge from generation to generation.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This ceremony is performed at the close of the period
Pa-chog&prime;, the period when rice seed is put in the germinating
beds.</p>
<p>It is claimed there is no special oral ceremony for Po-chang&prime;.
The proceeding is as follows: On the first day after the completion of
the period Pa-chog&prime; the regular monthly Pa&prime;-tay ceremony is
held. On the second day the men of ato Sigichan, in which ato Lumawig
resided when he lived in Bontoc, prepare a bunch of runo as large
around as a man&rsquo;s thigh. They call this the
&ldquo;cha-n&ucirc;g&prime;,&rdquo; and store it away in the ato fawi,
and outside the fawi set up in the earth twenty or more runo, called
&ldquo;pa-chi<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span>&prime;-pad&mdash;the
p&ucirc;d-p&ucirc;d&prime; of the harvest field.</p>
<p>The bunch of runo is for a constant reminder to Lumawig to make the
young rice stalks grow large. The pa-chi&prime;-pad are to prevent
Igorot from other pueblos entering the fawi and thus seeing the
efficacious bundle of runo.</p>
<p>During the ceremony of L&#301;s-l&#301;s, at the close of the annual
harvest of palay, both the cha-n&ucirc;g&prime; and the
pa-chi&prime;-pad are destroyed by burning.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On February 10, 1903, the rice having been practically
all transplanted in Bontoc, was begun the first of a five-day general
ceremony for abundant and good fruitage of the season&rsquo;s palay. It
was at the close of the period I-na-na&prime;.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the first day is called
&ldquo;Su-y&acirc;k&prime;.&rdquo; Each group of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7525" href="#xd21e7525" name=
"xd21e7525">208</a>]</span>kin&mdash;all descendants of one man or
woman who has no living ascendants&mdash;kills a large hog and makes a
feast. This day is said to be passed without oral ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the second day was a double one. The first was
called &ldquo;Wa-l&#301;t&prime;&rdquo; and the second
&ldquo;Mang&prime;-mang.&rdquo; From about 9.30 until 11 in the
forenoon a person from each family&mdash;usually a woman&mdash;passed
slowly up the steep mountain side immediately west of Bontoc. These
people went singly and in groups of two to four, following trails to
points on the mountain&rsquo;s crest. Each woman carried a small
earthen pot in which was a piece of pork covered with basi. Each also
carried a chicken in an open-work basket, while tucked into the basket
was a round stick about <span class="measure" title="35 centimeters">14
inches</span> long and <span class="measure" title=
"13 millimeters">half an inch</span> in diameter. This stick,
&ldquo;lo&prime;-lo,&rdquo; is kept in the family from generation to
generation.</p>
<p>When the crest of the mountain was reached, each person in turn
voiced an invitation to her departed ancestors to come to the
Mang&prime;-mang feast. She placed her olla of basi and pork over a
tiny fire, kindled by the first pilgrim to the mountain in the morning
and fed by each arrival. Then she took the chicken from her basket and
faced the west, pointing before her with the chicken in one hand and
the lo&prime;-lo in the other. There she stood, a solitary figure,
performing her sacred mission alone. Those preceding her were slowly
descending the hot mountain side in groups as they came; those to
follow her were awaiting their turn at a distance beneath a shady tree.
The fire beside her sent up its thin line of smoke, bearing through the
quiet air the fragrance of the basi.</p>
<p>The woman invited the ancestral anito to the feast, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-ni&prime;-to ad Lo&prime;-ko, su-ma-a-kay&prime;-yo
ta-in-mang-mang&prime;-ta-ko ta-ka-ka&prime;-n&#277;n si
mu&prime;-t&#277;g.&rdquo; Then she faced the north and addressed the
spirit of her ancestors there: &ldquo;A-ni&prime;-to ad La&prime;-god,
su-ma-a-kay&prime;-yo ta-in-mang-mang&prime;-ta-ko
ta-ka-ka&prime;-n&#277;n si mu&prime;-t&#277;g.&rdquo; She faced the
east, gazing over the forested mountain ranges, and called to the
<span class="corr" title="Source: spirts">spirits</span> of the past
generation there: &ldquo;A-ni&prime;-to ad Bar&prime;-l&#301;g
su-ma-a-kay&prime;-yo ta-in-mang-mang&prime;-ta-ko ta-ka-ka-n&#277;n si
<span class="corr" title=
"Source: mu-t&#277;g">mu&prime;-t&#277;g</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she brought her sacred objects back down the mountain another
woman stood alone by the little fire on the crest.</p>
<p>The returning pilgrim now puts her fowl and her basi olla inside her
dwelling, and likely sits in the open air awaiting her husband as he
prepares the feast. Outside, directly in front of his door, he builds a
fire and sets a cooking olla over it. Then he takes the chicken from
its basket, and at his hands it meets a slow and cruel death. It is
held by the feet and the hackle feathers, and the wings unfold and
droop spreading. While sitting in his doorway holding the fowl in this
position the man beats the thin-fleshed bones of the wings with a
short, heavy stick as large around as a spear handle. The fowl cries
with each of the first dozen blows laid on, but the blows continue
until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7551" href="#xd21e7551" name=
"xd21e7551">209</a>]</span>each wing has received fully half a hundred.
The injured bird is then laid on its back on a stone, while its head
and neck stretch out on the hard surface. Again the stick falls,
cruelly, regularly, this time on the neck. Up and down its length it is
pummeled, and as many as a hundred blows fall&mdash;fall after the
cries cease, after the eyes close and open and close again a dozen
times, and after the bird is dead. The head receives a few sharp blows,
a jet of blood spurts out, and the ceremonial killing is past. The man,
still sitting on his haunches, still clasping the feet of the pendent
bird, moves over beside his fire, faces his dwelling, and voices the
only words of this strangely cruel scene. His eyes are open, his head
unbending, and he gazes before him as he earnestly asks a blessing on
the people, their pigs, chickens, and crops.</p>
<p>The old men say it is bad to cut off a chicken&rsquo;s head&mdash;it
is like taking a human head, and, besides, they say that the pummeling
makes the flesh on the bony wings and neck larger and more
abundant&mdash;so all fowls killed are beaten to death.</p>
<p>After the oral part of the ceremony the fowl is held in the flames
till all its feathers are burned off. It is cut up and cooked in the
olla before the door of the dwelling, and the entire family eats of
it.</p>
<p>Each family has the Mang&prime;-mang ceremony, and so also has each
broken household if it possesses a sementera&mdash;though a lone woman
calls in a man, who alone may perform the rite connected with the
ceremonial killing, and who must cook the fowl. A lone man needs no
woman assistant.</p>
<p>Though the ancestral anito are religiously bidden to the feast, the
people eat it all, no part being sacrificed for these invisible guests.
Even the small olla of basi is drunk by the man at the beginning of the
meal.</p>
<p>The rite of the third day is called
&ldquo;Mang-a-pu&prime;-i.&rdquo; The sementeras of growing palay are
visited, and an abundant fruitage asked for. Early in the morning some
member of each household goes to the mountains to get small sprigs of a
plant named &ldquo;pa-lo&prime;-ki.&rdquo; Even as early as 7.30 the
pa-lo&prime;-ki had been brought to many of the houses, and the people
were scattering along the different trails leading to the most distant
sementeras. If the family owned many scattered fields, the day was well
spent before all were visited.</p>
<p>Men, women, and boys went to the bright-green fields of young palay,
each carrying the basket belonging to his sex. In the basket were the
sprigs of pa-lo&prime;-ki, a small olla of water, a small wooden dish
or a basket of cooked rice, and a bamboo tube of basi or tapui. Many
persons had also several small pieces of pork and a chicken. As they
passed out of the pueblo each carried a tightly bound club-like torch
of burning palay straw; this would smolder slowly for hours.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7566" href="#xd21e7566" name=
"xd21e7566">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the stone dike of each sementera the owner paused to place three
small stones to hold the olla. The bundle of smoldering straw was
picked open till the breeze fanned a blaze; dry sticks or reeds quickly
made a small, smoking fire under the olla, in which was put the pork or
the chicken, if food was to be eaten there. Frequently, too, if the
smoke was low, a piece of the pork was put on a stick punched into the
soil of the sementera beside the fire and the smoke enwrapped the meat
and passed on over the growing field.</p>
<p>As soon as all was arranged at the fire a small amount of basi was
poured over a sprig of pa-lo&prime;-ki which was stuck in the soil of
the sementera, or one or two sprigs were inserted, drooping, in a split
in a tall, green runo, and this was pushed into the soil. While the
person stood beside the efficacious pa-lo&prime;-ki an invocation was
voiced to Lumawig to bless the crop.</p>
<p>The olla and piece of pork were at once put in the basket, and the
journey conscientiously continued to the next sementera. Only when food
was eaten at the sementera was the halt prolonged.</p>
<p>A-s&#301;g-ka-cho&prime; is the name of the function of the fourth
day. On that day each household owning sementeras has a fish feast.</p>
<p>At that season of the year (February), while the water is low in the
river, only the very small, sluggish fish, called &ldquo;kacho,&rdquo;
is commonly caught at Bontoc. Between <span class="measure" title=
"100 and 150 kilograms">200 and 300 pounds</span> of those fish, only
one in a hundred of which exceeded <span class="measure" title=
"6 centimeters">2&frac12; inches</span> in length, were taken from the
river during the three hours in the afternoon when the ceremonial
fishing was in progress.</p>
<p>Two large scoops, one shown in <a href="#pl049">Pl. XLIX</a>, were
used to catch the fish. They were <span class="measure" title=
"400 meters">a quarter of a mile</span> apart in the river, and were
operated independently.</p>
<p>At the house the fish were cooked and eaten as is described in the
section on &ldquo;Meals and mealtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this fish meal was past the last observance of the fourth day
of the Cha&prime;-ka ceremonial was ended.</p>
<p>The rite of the last day is called &ldquo;Pa&prime;-tay.&rdquo; It
is observed by two old Pa&prime;-tay priests. Exactly at high noon
Kad-lo&prime;-san left his ato carrying a chicken and a smoldering
palay-straw roll in his hand, and the unique basket, tak-fa&prime;, on
his shoulder. He went unaccompanied and apparently unnoticed to the
small grove of trees, called &ldquo;Pa-pa-tay&prime; ad
So-kok&prime;.&rdquo; Under the trees is a space some <span class=
"measure" title="2&frac12; or 3 meters">8 or 10 feet</span> across,
paved with flat rocks, and here the man squatted and put down his
basket. From it he took a <span class="measure" title=
"2-liter">two-quart</span> olla containing water, a small wooden bowl
of cooked rice, a bottle of native cane sugar, and a head-ax. He next
kindled a blaze under the olla in a fireplace of three stones already
set up. Then followed the ceremonial killing of the chicken, as
described in the Mang&prime;-mang rite of the second day. With
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7604" href="#xd21e7604" name=
"xd21e7604">211</a>]</span>the scarcely dead fowl held before him the
man earnestly addressed a short supplication to Lumawig.</p>
<p>The fowl was then turned over and around in the flame until all its
feathers were burned off. Its crop was torn out with the fingers. The
ax was struck blade up solid in the ground, and the legs of the chicken
cut off from the body by drawing them over the sharp ax blade, and they
were put at once into the pot. An incision was cut on each side of the
neck, and the body torn quickly and neatly open, with the wings still
attached to the breast part. A glad exclamation broke from the man when
he saw that the gall of the fowl was dark green. The intestines were
then removed, ripped into a long string, and laid in the basket. The
back part of the fowl, with liver, heart, and gizzard attached, went
into the now boiling pot, and the breast section followed it promptly.
Three or four minutes after the bowl of rice was placed immediately in
front of the man, and the breast part of the chicken laid in the bowl
on the rice. Then followed these words: &ldquo;Now the gall is good, we
shall live in the pueblo invulnerable to disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breast was again put in the pot, and as the basket was packed up
in preparation for departure the anito of ancestors were invited to a
feast of chicken and rice in order that the ceremony might be
blessed.</p>
<p>At the completion of this supplication the Pa&prime;-tay shouldered
his basket and hastened homeward by a different route from which he
came.</p>
<p>If a chicken is used in this rite it is cooked in the dwelling of
the priest and is eaten by the family. If a pig is used the old men of
the priest&rsquo;s ato consume it with him.</p>
<p>The performance of the rite of this last day is a critical half hour
for the town. If the gall of the fowl is white or whitish the palay
fruitage will be more or less of a failure. The crop last year was
such&mdash;a whitish gall gave the warning. If a crow flies cawing over
the path of the Pa&prime;-tay as he returns to his dwelling, or if the
dogs bark at him, many people will die in Bontoc. Three years ago a man
was killed by a falling bowlder shortly after noon on this last
day&rsquo;s ceremonial&mdash;a flying crow had foretold the disaster.
If an eagle flies over the path, many houses will burn. Two years ago
an eagle warned the people, and in the middle of the day fifty or more
houses burned in Bontoc in the three ato of Pokisan, Luwakan, and
Ungkan.</p>
<p>If none of these calamities are foretold, the anito enemies of
Bontoc are not revengeful, and the pueblo rests in contentment.</p>

the earth and all things connected with it. Lumawig makes it rain and
storm, gives day and night, heat and cold. The earth is &ldquo;just as
you see it.&rdquo; It ceases somewhere a short distance beyond the most
distant place an Igorot has visited. He does not know how it is
supported. &ldquo;Why should it fall?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;A pot on
the earth does not fall.&rdquo; Above is chayya, the sky&mdash;the
Igorot does not know or attempt to say what it is. It is up above the
earth and extends beyond and below the visible horizon and the limit of
the earth. The Igorot does not know how it remains there, and a man
once interrupted me to ask why it did not fall down below the earth at
its limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Below us,&rdquo; an old Igorot told me, &ldquo;is just
bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun is a man called &ldquo;Chal-chal&prime;.&rdquo; The moon is
a woman named &ldquo;Ka-bi-gat&prime;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Once the moon was
also a sun, and then it was always day; but Lumawig made a moon of the
woman, and since then there is day and night, which is best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two kinds of stars. &ldquo;Fat-ta-ka&prime;-kan&rdquo; is
the name of large stars and &ldquo;t&ucirc;k-fi&prime;-fi&rdquo; is the
name of small stars. The stars are all men, and they wear white coats.
Once they came down to Bontoc pueblo and ate sugar cane, but on being
discovered they all escaped again to chayya.</p>
<p>Thunder is a gigantic wild boar crying for rain. A Bontoc man was
once killed by Ki-cho&prime;, the thunder. The unfortunate man was
ripped open from his legs to his head, just as a man is ripped and torn
by the wild boar of the mountains. The lightning, called
&ldquo;Y&ucirc;p-y&ucirc;p,&rdquo; is also a hog, and always
accompanies Ki-cho&prime;.</p>
<p>Lumawig superintends the rains. Li-fo&prime;-o are the rain
clouds&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7792" href="#xd21e7792"
name="xd21e7792">217</a>]</span>they are smoke. &ldquo;At night Lumawig
has the li-fo&prime;-o come down to the river and get water. Before
morning they have carried up a great deal of water; and then they let
it come down as rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earthquakes are caused by Lumawig. He places both hands on the edge
of the earth and quickly pushes it back and forth. They do not know why
he does it.</p>
<p>Regarding man himself the Igorot knows little. He says Lumawig gave
man and all man&rsquo;s functionings. He does not know the functioning
of blood, brain, stomach, or any other of the primary organs of the
body. He says the bladder of men and animals is for holding the water
they drink. He knows that a man begets his child and that a
woman&rsquo;s breasts are for supplying the infant food, but these two
functionings are practically all the facts he knows or even thinks he
knows about his body.</p>

<p class="first">The most common method of enumerating is that of the
finger count. The usual method is to count the fingers, beginning with
the little finger of the right hand, in succession touching each finger
with the forefinger of the other hand. The count of the thumb,
li&prime;-ma, five, is one of the words for hand. The sixth count
begins with the little finger of the left hand, and the tenth reaches
the thumb. The eleventh count begins with the little finger of the
right hand again, and so the count continues. The Igorot system is
evidently decimal. One man, however, invariably recorded his eleventh
count on his toes, from which he returned to the little finger of his
right hand for the twenty-first count.</p>
<p>A common method of enumerating is one in which the record is kept
with small pebbles placed together one after another on the ground.</p>
<p>Another method in frequent use preserves the record in the number of
sections of a slender twig which is bent or broken half across for each
count.</p>
<p>When an Igorot works for an American he records each day by a notch
in a small stick. A very neat record for the month was made by one of
our servants who prepared a three-sided stick less than <span class=
"measure" title="5 centimeters">2 inches</span> long. Day by day he cut
notches in this stick, ten on each edge.</p>
<p>When a record is wanted for a long time&mdash;as when one man loans
another money for a year or more&mdash;he ties a knot in a string for
each peso loaned.</p>
<p>The Igorot subtracts by addition. He counts forward in the total of
fingers or pebbles the number he wishes to subtract, and then he again
counts the remainder forward. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7823"

finger extended and opposed is the shortest linear measure used by the
Igorot, although he may measure by eye with more detail and exactness,
as when he notes half the above distance. This span measure is called
&ldquo;chang&prime;-an&rdquo; or &ldquo;i&prime;-sa
chang&prime;-an,&rdquo; &ldquo;chu&prime;-wa chang&prime;-an,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
<p>Chi-pa&prime; is the measure between the tips of the two middle
fingers when the arms are extended full length in opposite directions.
Chi-wan&prime; si chi-pa&prime; is half the above measure, or from the
tip of the middle finger of one hand, arm extended from side of body,
to the sternum.</p>
<p>These three measures are most used in handling timbers and boards in
the construction of buildings.</p>
<p>Cloth for breechcloths is measured by the length of the forearm,
being wound about the elbow and through the hand, quite as one coils up
a rope.</p>
<p>Long distances in the mountains or on the trail are measured by the
length of time necessary to walk them, and the length of time is told
by pointing to the place of the sun in the heavens at the hour of
departure and arrival.</p>
<p>Rice sementeras are measured by the number of cargoes of palay they
produce. Besides this relatively exact measure, sementeras producing up
to five cargoes are called &ldquo;small,&rdquo; pay-yo&prime; ay
fa-nig&prime;; and those producing more than five are said to be
&ldquo;large,&rdquo; pay-yo&prime;

<p>The size of a hog and, as with the carabao, an estimate of its value
is shown by representing the size of the girth of the animal by
clasping the hands around one&rsquo;s leg. For instance, a small pig is
represented by the size of the speaker&rsquo;s ankle, as he clasps both
hands around it; a larger one is the size of his calf; a still larger
one is the size of a man&rsquo;s thigh; and one still larger is
represented by the thigh and calf together, the calf being bent tightly
against the upper leg. To represent a still larger hog, the two hands
circle the calf and thigh, but at some distance from them.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Igorot has no mechanical record of time or events,
save as he sometimes cuts notches in a stick to mark the flight of
days. He is apt, however, in memorizing the names of ancestors, holding
them for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7853" href="#xd21e7853"
name="xd21e7853">219</a>]</span>half a dozen generations, but he keeps
no record of age, and has no adequate conception of such a period as
twenty years. He has no conception of a cycle of time greater than one
year, and, in fact, it is the rare man who thinks in terms of a year.
When one does he speaks of the past year as
t&#301;n-mo-w&#301;n&prime;, or i-san&prime; pa-na&prime;-ma.</p>
<p>Prominent Igorot have insisted that a year has only eight moons, and
other equally sane and respected men say it has one hundred. But among
the old men, who are the wisdom of the people, there are those who know
and say it has thirteen moons.</p>
<p>They have noted and named eight phases of the moon, namely: The
one-quarter waxing moon, called &ldquo;f&#301;s-ka&prime;-na;&rdquo;
the two-quarters waxing moon, &ldquo;ma-no&prime;-wa,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ma-lang&prime;-ad;&rdquo; the three-quarters waxing moon,
&ldquo;kat-no-wa&prime;-na&rdquo; or &ldquo;nap-no&prime;;&rdquo; the
full moon, &ldquo;f&#301;t-fi-tay&prime;-&#277;g;&rdquo; the
three-quarters waning moon, &ldquo;ka-tol-pa-ka&prime;-na&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ma-t&#301;l-pa&prime;-kan;&rdquo; the two-quarters waning moon,
&ldquo;ki-sul-fi-ka&prime;-na;&rdquo; the one-quarter waning moon,
&ldquo;s&#301;g-na&prime;-a-na&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ka-fa-ni-ka&prime;-na;&rdquo; and the period following the last,
when there is but a faint rim of light, is called
&ldquo;li&prime;-m&#277;ng&rdquo; or &ldquo;ma-a-mas&prime;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the Igorot do seldom count time by the phases of the moon,
and the only solar period of time they know is that of the day. Their
word for day is the same as for sun, a-qu&prime;. They indicate the
time of day by pointing to the sky, indicating the position the sun
occupied when a particular event occurred.</p>
<p>There are two seasons in a year. One is Cha-kon&prime;, having five
moons, and the other is Ka-s&#301;p&prime;, having eight moons. The
seasons do not mark the wet and dry periods, as might be expected in a
country having such periods. Cha-kon&prime; is the season of rice or
&ldquo;palay&rdquo; growth and harvest, and Ka-s&#301;p&prime; is the
remainder of the year. These two seasons, and the recognition that
there are thirteen moons in one year, and that day follows night, are
the only natural divisions of time in the Igorot calendar.</p>
<p>He has made an artificial calendar differing somewhat in all pueblos
in name and number and length of periods. In all these calendars the
several periods bear the names of the characteristic industrial
occupations which follow one another successively each year. Eight of
these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7886" href="#xd21e7886" name=
"xd21e7886">220</a>]</span>periods make up the calendar of Bontoc
pueblo, and seven of them have to do with the rice industry. Each
period receives its name from that industry which characterizes its
beginning, and it retains this name until the beginning of the next
period, although the industry which characterized it may have ceased
some time before.</p>
<p>I-na-na&prime; is the first period of the year, and the first period
of the season Cha-kon&prime;. It is the period, as they say, of no more
work in the rice sementeras&mdash;that is, practically all fields are
prepared and transplanted. It began in 1903 on February 11. It lasts
about three months, continuing until the time of the first harvest of
the rice or &ldquo;palay&rdquo; crop in May; in 1903 this was until May
2. This period is not a period of &ldquo;no work&rdquo;&mdash;it has
many and varied labors.</p>
<p>The second period is La&prime;-t&ucirc;b. It is that of the first
harvests, and lasts some four weeks, ending about June&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>Cho&prime;-ok is the third period. It is the time when the bulk of
the palay is harvested. It occupies about four weeks, running over in
1903 two days in July.</p>
<p>Li&prime;-pas is the fourth period. It is that of &ldquo;no more
palay harvest,&rdquo; and lasts for about ten or fifteen days, ending
probably about July 15. This is the last period of the season
Cha-kon&prime;.</p>
<p>The fifth period is Ba-li&prime;-l&#301;ng. It is the first period
of the season Ka-s&#301;p&prime;. It takes its name from the general
planting of camotes, and is the only one of the calendar periods not
named from the rice industry. It continues about six weeks, or until
near the 1st of September.</p>
<p>Sa-gan-ma&prime; is the sixth period. It is the time when the
sementeras to be used as seed beds for rice are put in condition, the
earth being turned three different times. It lasts about two months.
November 15, 1902, the seed rice was just peeping from the kernels in
the beds of Bontoc and Sagada, and the seed is sown immediately after
the third turning of the earth, which thus ended early in November.</p>
<p>Pa-chog&prime; is the seventh period of the annual calendar. It is
the period of seed sowing, and begins about November 10. Although the
seed sowing does not last many days, the period Pa-chog&prime;
continues five or six weeks.</p>
<p>Sa&prime;-ma is the last period of the calendar. It is the period in
which the rice sementeras are prepared for receiving the young plants
and in which these seedlings are transplanted from the seed beds. The
last Sa&prime;-ma was near seven weeks&rsquo; duration. It began about
December 20, <span class="corr" title="Source: 1903">1902</span>, and
ended February 10, 1903. Sa&prime;-ma is the last period of the season
Ka-s&#301;p&prime;, and the last of the year.</p>
<p>The Igorot often says that a certain thing occurred in
La&prime;-tub, or will occur in Ba-li&prime;-l&#301;ng, so these
periods of the calendar are held in mind as the civilized man thinks of
events in time as occurring in some particular month. <span class=

<p>The Igorot have a tradition that formerly the moon was also a sun,
and at that time it was always day. Lumawig told the moon to be
&ldquo;moon,&rdquo; and then there was night. Such a change was
necessary, they say, so the people would know when to work&mdash;that
is, when was the right time, the right moon, to take up a particular
kind of labor.</p>

<p class="first">The paucity of the pure mental life of the Igorot is
nowhere more clearly shown than in the scarcity of folk tales.</p>
<p>I group here seven tales which are quite commonly known among the
people of Bontoc. The second, third, fourth, and fifth are frequently
related by the parents to their children, and I heard all of them the
first time from boys about a dozen years old. I believe these tales are
nearly all the pure fiction the Igorot has created and perpetuated from
generation to generation, except the Lumawig stories.</p>
<p>The Igorot story-tellers, with one or two exceptions, present the
bare facts in a colorless and lifeless manner. I have, therefore, taken
the liberty of adding slightly to the tales by giving them some local
coloring, but I have neither added to nor detracted from the facts
related.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Moon, a woman called
&ldquo;Ka-bi-gat&prime;,&rdquo; was one day making a large copper
cooking pot. The copper was soft and plastic like potter&rsquo;s clay.
Ka-bi-gat&prime; held the heavy sagging pot on her knees and leaned the
hardened rim against her naked breasts. As she squatted
there&mdash;turning, patting, shaping, the huge vessel&mdash;a son of
the man Chal-chal&prime;, the Sun, came to watch her. This is what he
saw: The Moon dipped her paddle, called
&ldquo;p&#301;p-i&prime;,&rdquo; in the water, and rubbed it dripping
over a smooth, rounded stone, an agate with ribbons of colors wound
about in it. Then she stretched one long arm inside the pot as far as
she could. &ldquo;Tub, tub, tub,&rdquo; said the ribbons of colors as
Ka-bi-gat&prime; pounded up against the molten copper with the stone in
her extended hand. &ldquo;Slip, slip, slip, slip,&rdquo; quickly
answered p&#301;p-i&prime;, because the Moon was spanking back the many
little rounded domes which the stone bulged forth on the outer surface
of the vessel. Thus the huge bowl grew larger, more symmetrical, and
smooth.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Moon looked up and saw the boy intently watching the
swelling pot and the rapid playing of the paddle. Instantly the Moon
struck him, cutting off his head.</p>
<p>Chal-chal&prime; was not there. He did not see it, but he knew
Ka-bi-gat&prime; cut off his son&rsquo;s head by striking with her
p&#301;p-i&prime;.</p>
<p>He hastened to the spot, picked the lad up, and put his head where
it belonged&mdash;and the boy was alive. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Then the Sun said to the Moon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, because you cut off my son&rsquo;s head, the people of
the Earth are cutting off each other&rsquo;s heads, and will do so
hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is so,&rdquo; the story-tellers continue; &ldquo;they
do cut off each other&rsquo;s heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">A man and woman had two boys. Every day the mother
sent them into the mountains for wood to cook her food. Each morning as
she sent them out she complained about the last wood they brought
home.</p>
<p>One day they brought tree limbs; the mother complained, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wood is bad. It smokes so much that I can not see, and
soon I shall be blind.&rdquo; And then she added, as was her
custom:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not work well, you can have only food for dogs and
pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day, as usual, the boys had in their topil for dinner only
boiled camote vines, such as the hogs eat, and a small allowance of
rice, just as much as a dog is fed. At night the boys brought some very
good wood&mdash;wood of the pitch-pine tree. In the morning the mother
complained that such wood blackened the house. She gave them pig food
in their topil, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pig food is good enough for you because you do not work
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night each boy brought in a large bundle of runo. The mother
was angry, and scolded, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not good wood; it leaves too many ashes and it
dirties the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning she gave them dog food for dinner, and the boys again
went away to the mountains. They were now very thin and poor because
they had no meat to eat. By and by the older one said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here while I climb up this tree and cut off some
branches.&rdquo; So he climbed the tree, and presently called down:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is some wood&rdquo;&mdash;and the bones of an arm
dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; exclaimed the younger brother, &ldquo;it is
your arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the older boy called, &ldquo;Here is some more
wood&rdquo;&mdash;and the bones of his other arm fell at the foot of
the tree.</p>
<p>Again he called, and the bones of a leg dropped; then his other leg
fell. The next time he called, down came the right half of his ribs;
and then, next, the left half of his ribs; and immediately thereafter
his spinal column. Then he called again, and down fell his hair.</p>
<p>The last time he called, &ldquo;Here is some wood,&rdquo; his skull
dropped on the earth under the tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e7982" href="#xd21e7982" name="xd21e7982">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take those things home,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Tell the
woman that this is her wood; she only wanted my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no one to go with me down the mountains,&rdquo;
said the younger boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I will go with you, brother,&rdquo; quickly came the
answer from the tree top.</p>
<p>So the boy tied up his bundle, and, putting it on his shoulder,
started for the pueblo. As he did so the other&mdash;he was now
Co-l&#301;ng&prime;&mdash;soared from the tree top, always flying
directly above the boy.</p>
<p>When the younger brother reached home he put his bundle down, and
said to the woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the wood you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman and the husband, frightened, ran out of the house; they
heard something in the air above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qu-iu&prime;-kok! qu-iu&prime;-kok! qu-iu&prime;-kok!&rdquo;
said Co-l&#301;ng&prime;, as he circled around and around above the
house. &ldquo;Qu-iu&prime;-kok! qu-iu&prime;-kok!&rdquo; he screamed,
&ldquo;now camotes and palay are your son. I do not need your food any
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I want to eat mo&prime;-t&#301;ng,&rdquo; said the little

<p>At last her mother interrupted, &ldquo;It is bad to talk so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rice was then all pounded out. The mother winnowed it clean, and
put it in her basket, covering it up with the winnowing tray. She
placed an empty olla on her head and went to the spring for water.</p>
<p>The anxious little girl reached quickly for the basket to get some
rice, but the tray slipped from her grasp and fell, covering her
beneath it in the basket.</p>
<p>The mother returned with the water to cook supper. She heard a bird
crying, &ldquo;King! king! nik! nik! nik!&rdquo; When the woman
uncovered the basket, Tilin, the little brown ricebird, flew away,

no meat in the basket.</p>
<p>Finally one of the boys said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bad not to have meat to eat; every day we have only

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is bad,&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;We can not

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bontoc people have another folk tale regarding
head taking. In it Lumawig, their god, taught them how to discover
which pueblo had taken the head of one of their members. They repeat
this story as a ceremony in the pabafunan after every head lost, though
almost always they know what pueblo took it. It is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very great time ago a man and woman had two sons. Far up in
the mountains they owned some garden patches. One day they told the
boys to go and see whether the stone wall about the garden needed
repair; but the boys said they did not wish to go, so the father went
alone. As he did not return at nightfall, his sons started into the
mountains to find him. They bound together two small bunches of runo
for torches to light up the steep, rough, twisting trail. One torch was
burning when they went out, and they carried the other to light them
home again. Nowhere along the trail did they find their father; he had
not been injured in the path, nor could they find where he had fallen
over a cliff. So they passed on to the garden; there they found their
father&rsquo;s headless body. They searched for blood in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e8107" href="#xd21e8107" name=

nothing&mdash;no blood, no enemies&rsquo; tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They carried the strange corpse down the mountain trail to
their home in Bontoc. Then they hastened to the pabafunan, and there
they told the men what had befallen their father. The old men counseled
together, and at last one of them said: &lsquo;Lumawig told the old men
of the past, so the old men last dead told me, that should any son find
his father beheaded, he should do this: He should ask, &ldquo;Who took
my father&rsquo;s head? Did Tukukan take it? Did Sakasakan take
it?&rdquo;<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">&thinsp;&rsquo;</span> and Lumawig said, &lsquo;He
shall know who took his father&rsquo;s head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the boys took a basket, the fangao, to represent Lumawig,
and stuck it full of chicken feathers. Before the fangao they placed a
small cup of basi. Then squatting in front with the cup at their feet
they put a small piece of pork on a stick and held it over the cup.
&lsquo;Who took my father&rsquo;s head?&mdash;did Tukukan?&rsquo; they
asked. But the pork and the cup and the basket all remained still.
&lsquo;Did Sakasakan?&rsquo; asked the boys all was as before. They
went over a list of towns at enmity with Bontoc, but there was no
answer given them. At last they asked, &lsquo;Did the
Moon?&rsquo;&mdash;but still there was no answer. &lsquo;Did the
Sun?&rsquo; the boys asked, and suddenly the piece of pork slid from
the stick into the basi. And this was the way Lumawig had said a person
should know who took his father&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sun, then, was the guilty person. The two boys took some
dogs and hastened to the mountains where their father was killed. There
the dogs took up the scent of the enemy, and followed it in a straight
line to a very large spring where the water boiled up, as at Mayinit
where the salt springs are. The scent passed into this bubbling,
tumbling water, but the dogs could not get down. When the dogs returned
to land the elder brother tried to enter, but he failed also. Then the
younger brother tried to get down; he succeeded in going beneath the
water, and there he saw the head of his father, and young men in a
circle were dancing around it&mdash;they were the children of the Sun.
The brother struck off the head of one of these young men, caught up
his father&rsquo;s head, and, with the two heads, escaped. When he
reached his elder brother the two hastened home to their pueblo.&rdquo;

<p class="first">The language of the Bontoc Igorot is sufficiently
distinct from all others to be classed as a separate dialect. However,
it is originally from a parent stock which to-day survives more or less
noticeably over probably a much larger part of the surface of the earth
than the tongue of any other primitive people.</p>
<p>The language of every group of primitive people in the Philippine
Archipelago, except the Negrito, is from that same old tongue. Mr.
Homer B. Hulbert<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8131src" href="#xd21e8131"
name="xd21e8131src">1</a> has recorded vocabularies of ten groups of
people in Formosa; and those vocabularies show that the people belong
to the same great linguistic family as the Bontoc Igorot. Mr. Hulbert
believes that the language of Korea is originally of the same stock as
that of Formosa. In concluding his article he says:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">We find therefore that out of a vocabulary of fifty
words there are fifteen in which a distinct similarity [between Korean
and Formosan] can be traced, and in not a few of the fifteen the
similarity amounts to practical identity.</p>
</div>
<p>The Malay language of Malay Peninsula, Java, and Sumatra is from the
same stock language. So are many, perhaps all, the languages of Borneo,
Celebes, and New Zealand. This same primitive tongue is spread across
the Pacific and shows unmistakably in Fiji, New Hebrides, Samoa, and
Hawaii. It is also found in Madagascar.</p>

<p class="first">The Bontoc man has not begun even the simplest form of
permanent mechanical record in the line of a written language, and no
vocabulary of the language has before been published. <span class=

<p>The following alphabet was used in writing Bontoc words in this
study:</p>

</ul>
<p>The sounds which I have represented by the unmarked vowels <i>a, e,
i, o</i>, and <i>u</i>, Swettenham and Clifford in their Malay
Dictionary represent by the vowels with a circumflex accent. The sound
which I have indicated by <i>&ucirc;</i> they indicate by
<i>&#259;</i>. Other variations will be noted.</p>
<p>The sound represented by <i>a</i>, it must be noted, has not always
the same force or quantity, depending on an open or closed syllable and
the position of the vowel in the word.</p>
<p>So far as I know there is no <i>r</i> sound in the Bontoc Igorot
language. The word &ldquo;Igorot&rdquo; when used by the Bontoc man is
pronounced Igolot. In an article on &ldquo;The Chamorro language of
Guam&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8467src" href="#xd21e8467" name=
"xd21e8467src">2</a> it is noted that in that language there was
originally no <i>r</i> sound but that in modern times many words
formerly pronounced by an <i>l</i> sound now have that letter replaced
by <i>r</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e8480" href="#xd21e8480"

<h3 class="main">Linguistic inconsistencies</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The language of the Bontoc area is not stable, but is
greatly shifting. In pueblos only a few hours apart there are not only
variations in pronunciation but in some cases entirely different words
are used, and in a single pueblo there is great inconsistency in
pronunciation.</p>
<p>It is often impossible to determine the exact sound of vowels, even
in going over common words a score of times with as many people. The
accent seems very shifting and it is often difficult to tell where it
belongs.</p>
<p>Several initial consonants of words and syllables are commonly
interchanged, even by the same speaker if he uses a word more than once
during a conversation. That this fickleness is a permanency in the
language rather than the result of the present building of new words is
proved by ato names, words in use for many years&mdash;probably many
hundred years.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent interchanges is that of <i>b</i> and
<i>f</i>. This is shown in the following ato names:
Bu-yay&prime;-y&#277;ng or Fu-yay&prime;-y&#277;ng; Ba-tay&prime;-yan
or Fa-tay&prime;-yan; Bi&prime;-l&#301;g or Fi&prime;-l&#301;g; and
Long-boi&prime; or Long-foi&prime;. It is also shown in two other words
where one would naturally expect to find permanency&mdash;the names of
the men&rsquo;s public buildings in the ato, namely, ba&prime;-wi or
fa&prime;-wi, and pa-ba-bu&prime;-nan or pa-ba-fu&prime;-nan. Other
common illustrations are found in the words ba-to or fa-to (stone) and
ba-bay&prime;-i or fa-fay&prime;-i (woman).</p>
<p>Another constant interchange is that of <i>ch</i> and <i>d</i>. This
also is shown well in names of ato, as follows: Cha-kong&prime; or
Da-kong&prime;; Pud-pud-chog&prime; or Pud-pud-dog&prime;; and
Si-gi-chan&prime; or Si-gi-dan&prime;. It is shown also in
chi&prime;-la or di&prime;-la (tongue).</p>
<p>The interchange of initial <i>k</i> and <i>g</i> is constant. These
letters are interchanged in the following names of ato: Am-ka&prime;-wa
or Am-ga&prime;-wa; Lu-wa&prime;-kan or Lu-wa&prime;-gan; and
Ung-kan&prime; or Ung-gan&prime;. Other illustrations are
ku&prime;-l&#301;d or gu&prime;-l&#301;d (itch) and ye&prime;-ka or
ye&prime;-ga (earthquake).</p>
<p>The following three words illustrate both the last two interchanges:
Cho&prime;-ko or Do&prime;-go (name of an ato); pag-pa-ga&prime;-da or
pag-pa-ka&prime;-cha (heel); and ka-cho&prime; or ga-de&prime;-o
(fish).</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Nouns</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The nouns appear to undergo slight change to indicate
gender, number, or case. To indicate sex the noun is followed by the
word for woman or man&mdash;as, a&prime;-su fa-fay&prime;-i (female
dog), or a&prime;-su la-la&prime;-ki (male dog). The same method is
employed to indicate sex in the case of the third personal pronoun
Si&prime;-a or Si-to-di&prime;. Si&prime;-a la-le&prime;-ki or
Si-to-di&prime; la-la&prime;-ki is used to indicate the masculine
gender, and Si&prime;-a fa-fay&prime;-i or Si-to-di&prime;
fa-fay&prime;-i the feminine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e8521"
href="#xd21e8521" name="xd21e8521">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>The plural form of the noun is sometimes the same as the singular.
Plural number may also be expressed by use of the word ang-san (many)
or am-in&prime; (all) in addition to the noun. It is sometimes
expressed by repetition of syllables, as la-la&prime;-ki (man),
la-la-la&prime;-ki (men); sometimes, also, by the prefix ka together
with repetition of syllables, as li-fo&prime;-o (cloud),
ka-li&prime;-fo-li-fo&prime;-o (clouds). There seems to be no definite
law in accordance with which these several plural forms are made. When
in need of plurals in this study the singular form has always been used
largely for simplicity.</p>

<p>These possessive suffixes in the Benguet Igorot language are the
same, according to Scheerer, as the suffixes used in verbal
formation.</p>
<p>The verbal suffixes of the Bontoc Igorot are very similar to those
of the Benguet. It is therefore probable that the possessive suffixes
are also very similar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e8679" href=

<p>It is interesting to note that in the Chamorro language of Guam the
possessive suffixes for the first person correspond to those of the
Igorot&mdash;<i>my</i> is <i>ko</i> and <i>our</i> is <i>ta</i>.</p>

<p>The verbal suffixes seem to be commonly used by the Bontoc Igorot in
verbal formations. The tense of a verb standing alone seems always
indefinite; the context alone tells whether the present, past, or
future is indicated.</p>

<p class="first">About eighty-five words have been selected expressing
simple ideas. These are given in the Bontoc Igorot language and as far
as possible in the Benguet Igorot; they are also given in the Malay and
the Sulu languages.</p>
<p>Of eighty-six words in both Malay and Bontoc 32 per cent are clearly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e8868" href="#xd21e8868" name=

eighty-four words in the Sulu and Bontoc 45 per cent are from the same
root words. Of sixty-eight words in both Malay and Benguet 34 per cent
are from the same root words, and 47 per cent of sixty-seven Benguet
and Sulu words are from the same root words. Of sixty-four words in
Bontoc and Benguet 58 per cent are the same or nearly the same.</p>
<p>These facts suggest the movement of the Philippine people from the
birthplace of the parent tongue, and also the great family of existing
allied languages originating in the primitive Malayan language. They
also suggest that the Bontoc and the Benguet peoples came away quite
closely allied from the original nest, and that they had association
with the Sulu later than with the Malay.</p>
